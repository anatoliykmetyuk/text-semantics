president bush on tuesday nominated two individuals to replace retiring jurists on federal courts in the washington area.via microsoft watch from mary jo foleythis killing of a respected cleric will be causing us trouble for years to come.

i m staying away from the stock.

the sheikh in wheel  chair has been attacked with a f  16  launched bomb.i doubt the very few who actually read my blog have not come across this yet, but i figured i would put it out there anyways.the third was being run by the head of an investment firm.

john donovan from argghhh has put out a excellent slide show on what was actually found and fought for in fallujah.

he could be killed years ago and the israelians have all the reasons, since he founded and he is the spiritual leader of hamas, but they did nt.click here to view it.you wonder if he was manipulating the market with his bombing targets.

he makes some good observations on a few of the pics.

today s incident proves that sharon has lost his patience and his hope in peace.one of the pictures shows a flag that was found in fallujah.the cells were operating in the ghazaliyah and al  jihad districts of the capital.

on the next two pictures he took screenshots of two beheading videos.

nervous people make mistakes, so i suppose there will be a wave of succesfull arab attacks.compare the flags to the fallujah one.although the announcement was probably made to show progress in identifying and breaking up terror cells, i do nt find the news that the baathists continue to penetrate the iraqi government very hopeful.

you have to see these slides .... they are amazing.

a la guerre cest comme a la guerrethis fallujah operation my turn out to be the most important operation done by the us military since the end of the war.it reminds me too much of the arvn officers who were secretly working for the other side in vietnam.

let me join the chorus of annoyance over google s new toolbar, which, as noted in the linked article, commits just about every sin an online marketer could commit, and makes up a few new ones besides.

in the eastern city of baqubah, guerrillas detonated a car bomb outside a police station, killing several people.i m not fond of the google  hates  privacy argumental  zaman  guerrillas killed a member of the kurdistan democratic party after kidnapping him in mosul.

you do nt need to use their site, you can opt  out of sharing your information, you do nt need to send stuff to anyone with a gmail account, and if  wonder of wonders  you re worried that you might send something to someone who would forward an excerpt to someone who would then store it on a gmail account ... you have far, far too much time on your hands .

the us lost yet another helicopter to hostile fire near habbaniyah in the sunni heartland, but this time the crew was safe.however, this toolbar is really bad news.the police commander of ninevah province announced that bombings had declined 80 percent in mosul, whereas there had been a big jump in the number of kidnappings.

on the other hand, it looks pretty cool.

in fallujah, hundreds of demonstrators came out against us troops when they briefly arrested a yound newlywed bride.iran says it is creating nuclear energy without wanting nuclear weapons.on wednesday guerrillas had kidnapped a cosmetic surgeon and his wife while they were on their way home.

the united states does nt believe the iranian government.

i hope that the us army got an enormous amount of information from her relatives, because otherwise this move was a bad, bad tradeoff .one can suspect the iranian government.in suwayrah, kut province, two car bombs were discovered before they could be detonated.

but there is no proof.

the us troops fired into the hostile crowd, killing4.i read an article in time magazine accusing the iranian government of being willing to start a nuclear war and i sympathise with the article.kut is in southeastern iraq and has an overwhelmingly shiite population, who are on the lookout for baathist saboteurs and willingly turn them in.

they are certainly being nasty to the united nations security council in connection with the antiproliferation treaty.

it seems clear to me that the manhunt for high baath officials in the sunni heartland is being done wrong, or at least in ways that are bad for us standing with local iraqis.the president has also said he would like to see israel wiped off the map which he could nt even begin to try without nuclear weapons.this willingness is the main difference in the number of bombings in the south as opposed to the center  north of the country.

but he has insisted that he wants nuclear power for peaceful purposes.

google has finally had an analyst day  a chance to present the company s story to the  miniscule number of  people who have nt heard it.many people want to use diplomacy with iran rather than military pressure.in baghdad kadhim talal husain, assistant dean at the school of education at mustansiriyah university, was assassinated with his driver in the salikh district.

but will diplomacy work

usually, these are just a chance for the suckups to suck up, but this time people are actually concerned about the company s plans.and can anyone use military pressure without proofguerrillas killed an engineer, asi ali, from tikrit.

one reader pointed out that the president watched the americans in the embassy when they took them hostage.

they work on wall street, after all, so when they hear a company whos stated goals include  do nt be evil,  they imagine a company whos eventually history will be  do nt be profitable.he has denied this.they also killed shaikh hamid akkab, a clan elder of a branch of the dulaim tribe in tikrit.

we do nt have to believe him.

it s not quite as freewheeling an environment as you d imagine  sergey brin has actually created a mathematical  proof  that the company s self  driven research strategy, which gives employees one day a week to do research projects on their own, is a good, respectable idea.but we ca nt prove it.his mother was also killed in the attack.

it does seem that iranians frequently make statements and then hide behind lack of proof.

read the entire article  there s a punchline, too.angry crowds chanted antiamerican slogans in the western city of falluja  pop. 256,000  as the security police killed in a friendly fire incident by us troops were buried on saturday.two other dulaim leaders have been killed in the past week and a half.

reuters reported that  sunni clerics in the town issued a  declaration by the people of fallujah  condemning the deaths of the security guards and police, announcing three days of mourning, and calling for a general strike today.

my opinion piece on the implications of arafat s passing for al  qaeda has appeared at newsday.it read,  the people of fallujah condemn the massacre which was committed on friday against people dedicated to the protection of fallujah.guerrillas near hawijah launched an attack that left6 dead, including4 iraqi soldiers.

let aggressive  american  leaders and soldiers know that we are capable of protecting the city s security and safety, and ask them to lift their hands from the city.

excerptthe clerics demanded talks with local us commanders.one of them was from the jubur tribe and was deputy commander of the hawijah garrison.

falluja has long been roiled by tense relations with the us soldiers there, since local sunnis either remain committed to arab nationalism or have become sunni fundamentalists or even radicals.

arafat s secular nationalism was supple enough to compromise with israel and to imagine a two  state solution, even if the road of negotiations remained rocky.cities such as falluja received special treatment from saddam and enjoyed a disproportionate share of the country s wealth and power.two hundred members of the batawi clan of the dulaim demonstrated in baghdad on friday, protesting the killing of their clan elder, shaikh kadhim sarhid and4 of his sons, by gunmen wearing iraqi army uniforms.

they know that the american advent implies for them a demotion, and an elevation of the shiites and kurds, and they refuse to go quietly.

the continued israeli colonization of the occupied palestinian territories during the 1990s helped, along with terrorist attacks by radical groups such as hamas, to derail the peace process, which sharon had always opposed.see httpwww.gulfnews.comarticlesnews.asparticleid97508this is a largely sunni arab clan, and some sunni observers have accused shiite elements in the government of being behind the assassination  it is more likely the work of sunni arab guerrillas punishing the batawi leaders for cooperating with the dec. 15 elections.

the supreme court announced its ruling today in hamdan v. rumsfeld divided along idelogical lines with john roberts abstaining due to his involvement at the d.c. circuit level and anthony kennedy joining the liberals in a5 3 decision that is 185 pages long.

arafat s death creates a vacuum in palestinian leadership that will not soon be filled.the actual vote is a little confusing.al  zaman  the iraqi high electoral commission on friday denied a request of the debaathification commission to exclude 51 individuals from running on party lists in the dec. 15 elections on grounds of having been sufficiently involved in baath activities to warrant their being excluded from civil office.

stay with me now  john paul stevens delivered the opinion of the court with respect to parts i through iv, vi through vi  d  iii, vi  d  v, and vii, in which kennedy, souter, ginsburg, and breyer joined, and an opinion with respect to parts v and vi  d  iv, in which souter, ginsburg, and breyer joined.

sharon s assassination of major hamas leaders has also weakened authority structures in that party.breyer filed a concurring opinion, in which kennedy, souter, and ginsburg joined.the commission said it had no legal grounds for such an exclusion.

kennedy filed an opinion concurring in part, in which souter, ginsburg, and breyer joined as to parts i and ii.

if the israelis and the palestinian leadership can not find a way to reinvigorate the peace process, cells of radical young palestinians may grow up that look to bin laden for their cues.scalia filed a dissenting opinion, in which thomas and alito joined.this item is a small one and easily missed.

thomas filed a dissenting opinion, in which scalia joined, and in which alito joined as to all but parts i, ii  c 1, and iii  b 2.

even if local palestinian leaders remain strong enough to keep al  qaida out, the festering israeli  palestinian struggle remains among the best recruiting posters for al  qaida with young muslim men.alito filed a dissenting opinion, in which scalia and thomas joined as to parts i through iii.but in my view it is highly significant.

it will take me a little while to read the whole thing, but i rarely agree with a john paul stevens opinion.

resolving this conflict would be the most effective weapon the united states could deploy in its war on terror.i ll post highlights from the opinion and dissents when i m finished.the debaathification commission had been pushed by ahmad chalabi and his iraqi national congress very hard, and had pushed many sunni arabs into the arms of the guerrillas.

important news such as president bush s miniscule calibrations on his marriage amendment  antigay  update  he s not against gays in the bedroom, just at the altar, where of course their relationships should not only be frowned upon but should be constitutionally excluded  has pushed sudan not just off the front pages, or the a section, but out of the ny times and washington post completely.

xinhua reports that a wide range of iraqi political forces on tuesday condemned sharon s murder of sheikh ahmed yassin, a religious leader of hamas, the day before.i had to go to the bbc for this report.chalabi has been increasingly marginalized within iraq, however, despite his ties of clientelage with washington and tehran.

it s symptomatic, i suppose, of our fast  paced, 24 hour news  cycle lives, that the biggest short  term humanitarian crisis in the world would quickly be eclipsed, once our secretary of state was finished with his whirlwind tour, from the newspapers.

the board of muslim clerics in fallujah, 50 km west of baghdad,  condemned the assassination and promised immediate revenge against the coalition soldiers in iraq.it s just disappointing.he is no longer in the dominant shiite list, the united iraqi alliance, and wo nt have many seats in the new parliament.

most troubling, however, is the fact that the political will to end the crisis expressed a few short weeks ago seems to have ebbed.

ash  sharq al  awsat reports that fallujah was closed tuesday in a general strike.at that time, un secretary general kofi annan demanded steps be taken to end the ethnic violence in darfur within 48 hours.some 2,000 junior officers of the old baath army have been recalled to duty in recent months, something chalabi would have blocked if he could have.

two weeks later, and the violence continues.

us troops there clashed with guerrillas in a fight that left one iraqi dead.the african union is clearly not up to the task of keeping the peace, pledging 300 troops to an area that will need 15,000, according to analysts.now the electoral commission is refusing to punish people for mere past baath party membership.

and international donors have given only half of the relief aid that darfur needs, according to the local un officials.

in ramadi, there was a big demonstration.so hear we are, two weeks later, after that dazzling pr display two weeks ago by powell and annan, and the situation on the ground in darfur appears basically unchanged.the situation in iraq is only going to get better this way.

warren buffett is giving away 85  of his wealth, mostly to the bill and melinda gates foundation.

radical shiite cleric muqtada al  sadr said the attack was  criminal  and that  the zionists have left only one choice for the arabs, that of fighting and jihad .it s a move that really worries me  buffett s usual justification for keeping most of his money was that he was still compounding the value of his fortune at a pretty high rate, so any gifts now would mean significantly less money for the foundation later.if someone committed a crime against humanity, prosecute the person.

it s a little hard to parse, but at this point his ostensible view is that the gateses are very good money  redistributors, and he wants them to have the money as soon as possible.

the interim governing council issued a communique saying,  it is a proof of the emptiness of the israeli authority and a destruction of the peace endeavors in the region...which essentially sounds like he s worried that bill or melinda are going to die soon.if he or she did not, then they should have all the same rights as other iraqis.

i assume his actual reason is that he s worried that berkshire hathaway just ca nt grow quickly enough to justify his usual charity policy.

this operation would only consolidate the terrorist acts in the world and would not bring peace to the region,  the message claimed.i m not sure how the market will react.al  sharq al  awsat reports that a key eyewitness in the trial of saddam hussein for a 1982 massacre at dujail has died.

it does nt change the company s intrinsic worth, and as the article notes, the company might be added to a major index once the shares get more liquid.

xinhua alleged that  many of the iraqis, who suffer the american occupation of iraq, relate their case with that of the palestinian people, under the israeli occupation.on the other hand, this is essentially a statement that the company is overpriced from the guy who knows it best  and happens to be the best investor of the last century.a team from the court managed to take his deposition before he died.

em ... no ... the gates foundation mainly invests in medical research and education, that means donating now adds a tremendous value compared to donating in ten years.

in an apparently unrelated incidents, some eleven iraqis were killed by snipers on tuesday, including a group of police trainees in a bus near hilla and two police in kirkuk.because the 10.000.000 people dying from malaria will otherwise be dead.the trial begins again nov. 28.

i.e.

ever since the first whispers about google s ipo, most investors have feared that the stock would come public at such a ridiculously high price that, even with a spectacularly profitable business model and some nearly flawless execution, the price would be too high for investors to make a real profit.he s not giving 85  away, he s giving a number of shares each year that decrease in number at the rate of5  a year  until gone  .in baghdad the fighting still continues in several areas, mostly in sadr city and adhamiya.

he mentions his wife s death having an effect on him.

we ve moved on.it sounds pretty rational that he s saying that bill and melinda are at a prime spot, so starting the money hose now is a good idea, but buffet is still keeping most of his donation inside of berkshire where it will compound.baghdadis do nt venture much out of their neighbourhoods any more, you never know where you might get stuck.

bill over at the fourth rail has an excellent essay on how the msm and the un, even the leftist countries in europe, are basically accepting terrorist organizations as legitimate forms of a political party

we ve grown up.on the same day palestinians protest in support of hezbollah and syria, the terrorist group hamas has indicated it will participate in the scheduled upcoming parliamentary elections.there has been talk that the night curfew might be implemented again.

to the north in lebanon, there is serious debate within hezbollah about entering the lebanese political process in light of syria s promised withdrawal.

now, people wonder if google can even survive.syria has agreed to withdraw under the conditions set forth in unsc resolution 1559, which has already begun.my neighbourhood has been surrounded by american troops for three days now, helicopters have been circling over our heads nonstop.

un secretary  general kofi annan has indicated it is time to  recognize hezbollah  after easily being duped by  the message on the placards they are using .

that s overstating it, i know.this acceptance of blatantly terrorist groups as legitimate freedom movements is a cancerous tumor on the united nations and the media.fedayeen are now visible on the street and they have become bolder than ever.

over three years after 911, the united nations, despite their attempts to project strength in fighting terrorism, still can not properly define the word  terrorist , waffling over the issue of whether the murder of innocent civilians are terrorist acts.

what they wonder is whether google can be anything more than what it s always been  a great search engine with some real grass  roots support, successful by the grace of simplicity.the media routinely obscures the lines between terrorism and legitimate resistance, as the recent article by daniel okrent of the new york times demonstrates.yesterday there were tens of them putting road blocks on our street and setting up mortars, they only come out in the open when americans leave the area, then they start firing mortars indiscriminately and shooting their ak  47s in the air.

...

simplicity gave it that blessed, laudatory lack of clutter, the efficient and effective text  based ads, and the support of anyone with a dial  up connection.the decision to sidestep the obvious to satisfy the need to avoid confrontation does not bring peace, but only delays the eventual conflict as the predators of hamas and hezbollah exploit the inherent weakness of the internationals and the media.they are setting the road blocks at the exact same positions they were during the war last year, which indicates they are the same people.

i ve been fuming over this fact for a few weeks now, ever since some organizations and governments suggested we need to accept the fact that hezbollah will get involved in running lebanon.

the problem is that customers attracted by a simple interface are among the least loyal you can find  witness the fight  for  fewest  features between low  end camera companies.wtf is thisand there is nothing we can do about it really, people who are suggesting that we go out and fight them are living in dream land.

this is a terrorist organization plain and simple.

the other problemthis is the organization that bombed our marine barracks in 1983, took americans hostage throughout the 80s and now they should be considered a legitimate organizationeven the ip and icdc have abandoned the neighbourhood, and those are trained and armed, so do nt expect scared civilians to do anything except to hide inside and pray a helicopter or a tank does nt bomb them, and also how are american soldiers going to distinguish the brave and valiant civilians from the fedayeen

this is just another reason to never trust the msm, and certainly not the europeans.

it s tough to make money branching out when your appeal is in your focus.the iraqi islamic party lead by muhsin abdul hamid, has been among the few sunni muslim groups willing to cooperate  even if rather lukewarmly  with the americans.everyone is apprehensive, there is some talk that april 9th and 10th are going to be bloody days.

it is now threatening to pull out of the allawi caretaker government.

as the survey cited in the above  linked article shows, most google users do nt intend to use gmail, and google is nt even as popular as yahoo and aol.the iip had also been the main force urging sunni arabs to participate in the elections scheduled for january, and had been opposed in this stance by the association of muslim scholars.most people have nt gone to work the last few days, although it seems that the rest of baghdad is  normal   if you can define what normal is .

that the iraqi islamic party is now contemplating leaving the allawi government raises the question of whether a mass sunni arab boycott of the elections is in the offing, thus fatally weakening the legitimacy of any new government.

if they continue to add features so they can justify their likely sky  high valuation, google risks losing a huge chunk of their customer base to the next keep  it  simple search engine.az  zaman  the association of muslim scholars forbade iraqis to participate in the attack on fallujah with the americans.there are rumours about preparations by slum dwellers for another looting spree against banks, governmental and public property similar to the one that took place last april, and i have already overheard youngsters in my neighbourhood joking about it and saying things like  this time we will be the first to loot, we did nt get anything the last time .

in a communique, the ams said that for iraqis to take part with  raiding forces  in the assault on a city, the population of which is muslim  such as fallujah  would be considered the most mortal of mortal sins.

remember when a whole lot of people had to die because a swedish newspaper printed those cartoons of the prophet mohammedthe sunni ams told iraqis,  you sinned when you participated with occupation forces in the assault on najaf, and beware lest you repeat this same sin in fallujah.mosques are calling for donating blood, food, and medicine for fallujah, and several convoys have already headed out for fallujah, most of them returned later though.

remember that the occupation is emphemeral.

now iran wants to turn the tables and is inviting cartoonists to do their best by depicting the holocaust.the radical shiite sadr movement issued a statement forbidding the participation of iraqi troops in the attack on fallujah, as well.what irritates me is this sudden false  solidarity  between sunni and shiite clerics, we all know that they would be glad to get at each other s throats when they have the chance, and shia clerics were describing fallujan insurgents as  baathists ,  saddamites ,  wahhabis , and  terrorists  just a few days ago.

the statement said,  we direct an appeal at the men in the iraqi forces, whether national guards or others, the majority of whom are muslim, calling upon them to refrain for commiting this enormous sin under the banner of forces that do not respect our religion or any principles of basic humanity, and we ask them to view this war as illegal.

amazingly, these idiots think a cartoon of mohammed is comparable to what we can expect in this new fun contestit called a  ploy  the assertaion that the attack was merely on foreign fighters at fallujah.so what happened

the convergence of views among the more militant sunni muslim clerics of ams and the radical shiites of the sadr movement has been seen before, last spring during the initial us assault on fallujah and during the us attack on mahdi army militiamen in najaf.

tehran  afpmost shiites, however, are still reluctant to take major risks to support the sunnis of fallujah, many of whom had supported saddam and his antishiite pogroms.i guess it s just the old new arab  me against my brother, me and my brother against my cousin, me and my cousin against my enemy , or  the enemy of my enemy is my friend  thing going on again.

president bush pinched a few nerves yesterday with his choice of words

an international contest of cartoons on the holocaust opened in tehran in response to the publication in western papers last september of caricatures of the prophet mohammed.washington  reutersspeaking of fallujah, we have only al  jazeera to rely on for our news from there.

u.s. muslim groups criticized president bush on thursday for calling a foiled plot to blow up airplanes part of a  war with islamic fascists,  saying the term could inflame antimuslim tensions.

we staged this fair to explore the limits of freedom westerners believe in,  masoud shojai, head of the country s  iran cartoon  association and the fair organizer, said.u.s. officials have said the plot, thwarted by britain, to blow up several aircraft over the atlantic bore many of the hallmarks of al qaeda.they have sent over their top reporter ahmed mansour to the town, and he is spouting all kinds of propaganda hourly reminding me of al  sahhaf.

we believe this is an ill  advised term and we believe that it is counterproductive to associate islam or muslims with fascism,  said nihad awad, executive director of the council on american  islamic relations advocacy group.

they can freely write anything they like about our prophet, but if one raises doubts about the holocaust he is either fined or sent to prison,  he added.which is why he did nt say we re at war with islamic people.they are targetting ambulances ,  american snipers are shooting children and pregnant women , and  they are using cluster bombs against civilians  is all you get to hear from him.

we re at war with islamic fascists.

though we do not deny that fact that jews were killed in the  second world  war, why should the palestinians pay for itby using the word  islamic  as an adjective bush was purposely not associating muslims with fascism, hence the qualifier.he did once make an unforgivable error when he mentioned that fallujan militants were shooting at the marines from the roofs of mosques and houses in hay al  golan, but of course that is okay for al  jazeera.

he reports that the iraqi islamic party, which had earlier been absolutely committed to getting out the sunni vote, is now wavering and saying their position will depend on the situation.this pledge is a new development.the prestigious iaea  international atomic energy agency  published an early report on chernobyl which was based on information from russian sources and stated that there was no significant health effects.

abu musab al  zarqawi and his group are said to have been bitter rivals of al  qaeda during the afghan resistance days.

the outbreak of demonstrations and violence throughout the sunni arab regions on wednesday did not bode well for sunni participation in the january elections.one witness at the moutasaddiq trial in germany alleged that zarqawi had not allowed monotheism and holy war to share resources with al  qaeda in the early zeroes of the 21st century.however, in april 2001, the iaea published fifteen years after the chernobyl accident  lessons learned. which contradict the earlier reports.

if the statement is true, it is a worrying sign that even the divided small radical guerrilla groups are being  picked up  by al  qaeda.

jim lobe has more on the political implications of the fallujah assault, both in iraq and in washington.this consolidation is obviously a result of bush s aggressive invasion of iraq and of the botching of the aftermath.here are some excerpts

it is a setback for the war on terror.

for some black satire on fallujah, see unconfirmed sources which has some fun with my weblog.al  qaeda in afghanistan was a group of only a few hundred  afghan arabs  who pledged personal loyalty to usamah bin laden.the dramatic increase in radiation  induced thyroid cancers in children and adolescents in belarus, russia, and ukraine, which have been observed since 1991, continues to this day.

it could notionally be expanded to encompass the 5,000  strong  55th brigade  of the taliban regime, though this is not the technical definition.

am at a conference and ca nt blog much right now but will try to catch up the next couple of days.because usamah is saudi, my guess is that they were especially influenced by an extremist form of the wahhabi school of islam that predominates among saudia s some 15 million citizens.... a drop in the birth rate, a deterioration in women s reproductive health, an increase in complications during pregnancy and birth, and a deterioration in neonatal health ....

in 1998 they were joined by egyptians from the al  jihad al  islami group of ayman al  zawahiri  many of these were from upper egypt, especially asyut and environs .

the hottest item on christmas wish lists this year is nuclear weapons.after that point, al  qaeda was a joint enterprise between the egyptian extremists and the polyglot arabs around bin laden, only some of whom were saudi.the dynamics of change in the state of health of children affected by the chernobyl accident in all three countries  belarus, russia, and ukraine  in the postaccident period is characterized by persistent negative tendencies  the morbidity rate is going up, the number of really healthy children is dropping, and disability is increasing.

zarqawi is a jordanian, and his monotheism and holy war group in afghanistan probably had a distinctive coloration as mainly jordanian, palestinian and syrian.

al  qaeda wants them, iran wants them, russia wants the better ones, and all the us wants is to give them all a piece of coal.they also had a special connection to some extremists in jordan and germany.as a parent, i can well imagine how painful it must be for those families whose children are succumbing to radiation poisoning.

they are probably especially oriented toward the salafi school of modern islamic thought, which has a protestant  like emphasis on going back to the original practice of the early companions of the prophet muhammad.

for the last few years there have been tensions with iran s nuclear program with word coming this week that a deal was reached through the european union that meets with the approval of the international atomic energy agency.most salafis are not militant or violent, though they tend to be rather narrow  minded in my experience, on the order of protestant pietists .there is a lot to learn about chernobyl.

monotheism and holy war obviously does have a violent interpretation of salafism, rather as the the leaders of the so  called german peasant rebellion among early protestants did.

at the same time, an iranian opposition group released what they call proof of a covert nuclear weapons program.another worrisome sign is that local iraqi sunni fundamentalists opposed to the us presence in iraq have begun joining monotheism and holy war, and wearing its distinctive orange and black insignia.being well  informed will give you certainty and that is desirable in a world of conflicting reports.

these have been sighted among iraqi crowds on haifa street in baghdad and in samarra.

arial photos, loose connections to aq kahn and libya make up the evidence that the group presented.so now there are hundreds of al  qaeda members in iraq where there had been none before.there are a wealth of references on chernobyl.

the consolidation of smaller local radical fundamentalist groups with al  qaeda can also be seen in the case of the fizazi group in tangiers that morphed into the moroccan islamic combatant group, had members who met with september 11 ringleader muhammad atta, and ultimately was in part responsible for the madrid train bombings.

russia also announced that it was seeking and building the best nukes the world s ever seen.the september 11 panel will issue its findings on thursday.read some of the following links and draw your own conclusions.

it notes 10 points at which the us made key mistakes that might have stopped bin laden s plot.

president vladimir putin said russia is will have new nuclear weapons that other countries do not and will not have.four of these were under clinton and6 under bush.these links present the many viewpoints that existed and still exist about the disaster called chernobyl

bush came out today and said that if he had known what was coming, he would have expended every effort to stop it, and that so would have clinton.

with the demand so high, the question arises on to who should be or has the right to be the santa of nuclear weapons.this statement is, despite its facade of fair  mindedness, so many weasel words.iaea report lessons learned

of course bush would have tried to stop 911 if he had known it was coming.

right now that seems to be the us, eu, and iaea.the question is,  should he have known it was cominghttpwww.ibiblio.orgexposoviet.exhibitchernobyl.html

the answer is,  yes

but not always do those three agree, and not always are their decisions equal.we now know that bush and his administration came into office obsessed with iraq.httpwww.ibrae.ac.ruibraeengchernobylnatrepnatrepe.htm24

cheney was looking at maps of iraq oil fields and muttering about opportunities for us companies there, already in january or february of 2001.

the us has strongly opposed a nuclear weapons program of iran, yet israel, which to this day has never officially said that they posses nuclear weapons, ranks around fifth in nuclear strength.wolfowitz contradicted counterterrorism czar richard clarke when the latter spoke of the al  qaeda threat, insisting that the preeminent threat of terrorism against the us came from iraq, and indicating he accepted laurie mylroie s crackpot conspiracy theory that saddam was behind the 1993 world trade towers bombing.httpwww.nsrl.ttu.educhernobylwildlifepreserve.htm

if you believe crackpot theories instead of focusing on the reality  that was an al  qaeda operation mainly carried out by al  gamaa al  islamiyyah, an egyptian terrorist component allied with bin laden  then you will concentrate on the wrong threat.

it is estimated that israel has over 200 nuclear weapons yet neither the us nor any of her allies expresses the slightest concern.even after the attacks on september 11, bush was obsessing about iraq.httpwww.environmentalchemistry.comyogihazmatarticleschernobyl1.html

wolfowitz lied to him and said that there was a 10 to 50  chance that iraq was behind them.

north korea s kim jong ill also has the bomb at the top of his list and santa seems to have already come a few years ago.on what evidencehttpdigonva.tripod.comchernobyl.htm

the hijackers were obviously al  qaeda, and no operational links between al  qaeda and iraq had ever been found .

it is rumored that north korea has at least a couple nuclear weapons.rumsfeld initially rejected an attack on al  qaeda bases in afghanistan, saying there were  no good targets  in afghanistan.httpwww.oneworld.orgindexocissue196byckau.html

what about 40 al  qaeda bases that had trained the 911 hijackers and other terrorists gunning for the united states

but getting past who should get them, is who has them, and who is really close.the pentagon did not even have a plan for dealing with afghanistan or al  qaeda that it could pull off the shelf, according to bob woodward.httpwww.collectinghistory.netchernobyl

bush did not have his eye on the ball.

the case against iran has a feeling of deja vu.neither did cheney, rumsfeld, or wolfowitz.httpwww.ukrainianweb.comchernobylukraine.htm

they were playing captain ahab to saddam s great white whale.

arial photos of the lab were uranium is being enriched, somewhat like those of chemical weapons stockpiles in iraq.imperial hubris makes the case that lots of people in the cia and counterterrorism divisions elsewhere in the us government knew all about bin laden and the threat he posed.httpwww.bullatomsci.orgissues1993s93s93marples.html

they were from all accounts marginalized and not listened to.

america cried wolf in iraq, and what s scary is that sooner or later, that wolf will probably get us.bush demoted dick clarke, among the most vocal and focused of the al  qaeda experts, from his cabinet.httpwww.calguard.ca.goviachernobyl1520years.htm

dick could never thereafter get any real cooperation from the cabinet officers, who outranked him, and he could not convince them to go to battle stations in the summer of 2001 when george tenet s hair was  on fire  about the excited chatter the cia was picking up from radical islamist terrorists.

i ran across this item on the internet.as for the clinton administration, let me say one thing in its defense.httpwww.infoukes.comhistorychornobylgregorovichindex.html

clinton had worked out a deal with pakistani prime minister nawaz sharif in summer of 1999 that would have allowed the us to send a special ops team in after bin laden in qandahar, based from pakistan.

sooooo.i presume you need the pakistan base for rescue operations in case anything went wrong.httpwww.un.orghachernobyl

you also need pakistani air space.

the united states goes into a war zone and evacuates a bunch of u.s. citizens  most of whom were  dual  citizens  .the plan was all set and could have succeeded.httpwww.tecsoc.orgpubshistory2002apr26.htm

but in fall of 1999, gen. pervez musharraf made a coup against nawaz sharif.

then, eschewing normal procedure, the department of state waived the fees that they charge for evacuating u.s. citizen.the pakistani army was rife with elements protective of the taliban, and the new military government reneged on the deal.httpwww.chernobyl.org.ukpage2.htm

musharraf told clinton he could nt use pakistani soil or air space to send the team in against bin laden.

whylook at a map and you try to figure out how, in fall of 1999, you could possibly pull off such an operation without pakistani facilities.httpwww.time.comtimedailychernobyl860901.accident.html

of course, you could just go in by main force.

to pander to the mythical  arab street , of course.but for those of you tempted in that direction, please look up carter s tabas operation.httpwww.infoukes.comhistorychornobylelg

it should be easily googled.

now, i would argue that one could have reasonably predicted that some form of military violence was likely to occur in lebanon  considering that the country has been experiencing some form of conflict for approximately the last 32 years .clinton tried, and tried hard.httpwww.worldnuclear.orginfochernobylinf07.htm

the gods were nt with us on that one.

in other words, those americans were there by their own choice, mired in a situation that was totally predictable.that is how i want you to refer to me as  the kinghttpwww.nea.frhtmlrpchernobylconclusions5.html

i do nt think so.

yet we did nt charge them for the evacuation.i m the kinghttpwww.nea.frhtmlrpchernobylc01.html

yeah

this is unlike the situation last year in asia when we evacuated u.s. citizens from areas that were hit by the tsunami  a phenomenon that is much less predictable than the hezbollah  provoked destruction that rained down on lebanon.sounds exciting.httpwww.nea.frhtmlrpchernobylc05.html

want to go to dinner with me before you have your  matt time

and what do we get for this effortprobablyl gon na just kick ithttpwww.physics.isu.eduradinfchern.htm

you know, whatever.

a lawsuit.i will let you know later.httpwww.chernobyl.infoen

what are you doing tonight.

that s right, folks.like whathttpwww.arps.org.auchernobyl.htm

i can think of a few things

the american  arab discrimination committee is suing condoleeza rice and donald rumsfeld, charging that they mismanaged the evacuation efforts.you r retarded.httpwwwformal.stanford.edujmcprogresschernobyl.html

i used to have one.

here s an excerpt from the articlethey are great dogs.httpwww.21stcenturysciencetech.comarticleschernobyl.html

cocker spaniels are retarded.

nina chahine, 19, who with her family was among the named plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said her wedding in the southern city of tyre was set for july 13.why do you think i should get one of thosei would be interested in hearing what conclusions you reached and what you found that was most convincing.

ca nt believe you left last night.

the wedding had to be postponed as family members fled the outbreak of the war, she said.nice sarcasm.radiation

that s fine, i do nt want to see you either, i just need to make a cd.

we were on the road and the first bridge was bombed and we drove home and all the other bridges were bombed and there was absolutely no way for us to get home,  chahine told reporters outside federal court in detroit.i ca nt waitas a child in the 50s i had a lot of glandular problems and they treated it with radiation therapy  primitive at best   and stopped when a lesion on my neck started enlarging  they said it was not ca but stopped the treatments ....

i was thinking somewhere that requires a jacket, like tony s.

we were all american citizens and there was no way that anybody helped us.someplace that is like  30 an entree.remember the old shoe sizing machines that was a form of radiation xray

yeah, i was thinking somewhere like mcdonald s.

no communications nothing.that may be too nice though.that too was stopped.

what do you think

i was on my way to my wedding fearing death, basically.we can go somewhere nice.do nt have to mention what radiation has done and is still doing to hirsohima  nagaski folks  there can be no doubts about the effects of radiation in chernobyl .......

real nice.

chahine said her immediate family spent about  20,000 to return to detroit via syria and jordan.oh.the chernobyl children s project  httpwww.adiccp.orghomedefault.asp  offers several ways to help the children of that region.

my bad.

dear nina,i must have had you messed up with some other girl i made the bet with.one of them is the rest and recuperation program, wherein a child can come to the us for a few weeks in the summer.

bet

here s a tip  do nt get married in countries that house illegal militias that attack other countries and hence are likely to come under counterattackreally, i have no idea what you re talking about.even a little time spent receiving wholesome, uncontaminated food, good medical care, etc. can add years to their lives.

you must be thinking of someone else.

crap like this sure makes me want to rush right out and rescue people from dilemmas of their own making.i do nt even like am, i would nt bet on them.s. and i have an acquaintance who has hosted several of these children for many years  to see these little ones breaks the heart.

colorado beat texas am.

though i am loathe to quote other writers at legnth in this space, this little bit from dan froomkin s  white house briefing  column in the washpost today is just too good to pass up  read the whole column herei know you remember the bet.the urge to protect and gather them all in is almost overwhelming, and makes me more grateful for the blessings i have.

no.

at the ask the president event on friday, one of the questions was about whether bush has any thoughts about his memoirs.i got her number though.take care, my friend, linda

i want to hook up with that girl paige in the brown leather jacket.

this is one example of what happens when bush gets a question that he has nt anticipated.what happened to youi m sorry to say elena s story has been revealed to be a fake.

i had a blast that night.

q thank you  i was wondering, there s a lot of talk right now about memoirs being written with the former president.did you hook up with that blonde chick saturday nightwhat do the new al  qaeda videotape and audio speeches of bin laden and ayman al  zawahiri tell us about the hopes of the remaining top leadership of the organization

no i am not lying.

after you are elected in 2004, what will your memoirs say about you, what will the title be, and what will the main theme sayi flew here last night.because the us and pakistan have managed to capture or kill about2  3s of the top 25 al  qaeda commanders, the middle managers are not in close contact with al  zawahiri and bin laden.

are you lying

the president  i appreciate that.i am out of town.the tape was a way to signal priorities.

i am in portland.

laughter.you can buy me dinner when we get back.these are1  assassinate or overthrow gen. pervez musharraf, the pakistani military  president  who had made a coup in 1999 and has thrown in his lot with the united states against the taliban and al  qaeda.

i am sure they are.

there is a painting on my wall in the oval  first of all, i do nt know.houston wo nt be too affected bc most of the layoffs affect satelite offices.musharraf has been trying to purge his officer corps of the substantial number of al  qaeda sympathizers.

economy should be good here.

i m just speculating now.hopefully she does nt hose you.his military intelligence has captured major figures like abu zubayda and khalid shaykh muhammad, as well as nearly 500 other al  qaeda operatives, over 400 of whom the pakistanis have turned over to the us.

i ll probably start looking next weekend.

i really have nt thought about writing a book.i heard that more may be going up for sale in the next month or do.musharraf held elections in october of 2002, in which center  right parties did well, but in which nearly 20 percent of parliament seats went to the fundamentalist religious party coalition, mma.

someone told me that chase is planning a shitload of layoffs.

my life is too complicated right now trying to do my job.i am not sure how reliable that is, though.mma also captured the northwest frontier province, which probably shelters bin laden and al  zawahiri, and is in a joint government of baluchistan province, also on the afghanistan border.

she is waiting to see if she can get financing.

laughter.mike mcconnellif al  qaeda can kill musharraf or instigate a military coup against him by islamist junior officers, they can hope to catapult the mma to power as political allies and hosts.

but if  there s a painting on the wall in the oval office that shows a horseman charging up a steep cliff, and there are at least two other horsemen following.john,they would thereby gain control of a major base for terrorist operations, which is also a nuclear power.

hello from south america.

it s a western scene by a guy named w.h.s. koerner called  a charge to keep.i just got your email and i certainly concur with jeff making the call.all this is highly unlikely, as with most al  qaeda crackpot schemes.

he has maintained a good relationship with mulva.

it s on loan, by the way, from a guy named joe oneill in midland, texas.this was a risk that we had but we did have assurances from phillips regarding performance.but so was it unlikely that a small group of arab mujahidin would virtually take over afghanistan.

i do nt know how much it will help however.

he was the person, he and his wife jan, introduced  reintroduced me and laura in his backyard in july of 1977.richard harper and mary nell browning may have some ideas here but i am sure you ve already gone through it with them.response  the us must do whatever it can to strengthen the legitimacy of the pakistani government.

i am amazed how the details get fuzzy on an old project.

four months later, we were married.when you discussed it, i was trying to think back to our remedies and discussions but the3 years have made it difficult.on the one hand, it should pressure musharraf to take off his uniform and run for president in a fair election, and to repeal the contentious  legal framework order  that essentially perpetuates his dictatorship.

i do nt know if there is anything i can do but i m always willing to help.

so he s got a  i m a decision  maker and i can make good decisions.good luck,on the other, restrictions should be lifted on the mainstream muslim league  n and pakistan people s party, who can defeat the mma in fair elections if not hogtied by the secret police.

laughter.following up on your and ken lay s conversation with gary cohn, i would like to forward the following proposal, acting for each of goldman sachs capital markets and j. aron.the kashmir issue generates far more terrorism, and even the threat of nuclear war, than iraq ever did.

the hymn was sung at my first inaugural church service as governor.there are only two counterparties at this time who have overdue marginbut sharon s iron fist is simply not working as a means of establishing general peace, and the bush administration will have to finally apply effective pressure on sharon to stop his outrages in and colonization of the west bank and gaza.

stephanie

i have.not sure, but i assume that the bluegrass songbook is mine.response  iraq is actually hostile territory for al  qaeda, and without iraqi sympathizers it can not succeed there.

is it for guitar

the hymn talks about serving something greater than yourself in life.i ll need to ponder.by moving quickly to iraqi sovereignty and improvement of iraqi lives, the us may be able to get iraqis on its side, so that they turn in the foreigners.

i ll try to get back to you pronto.

i  which i try to do, as best as i possibly can.fyi.certainly, the shiites already hate al  qaeda and would help  likewise the kurds.

we have this report

applause.hi davidthe problem of mollifying the sunnis, though, has to be solved to avoid giving al  qaeda an entree.

thought that you might be interested.

the book  i guess one way, one thing to think about it is  one of the themes would be, i was given a charge to keep.best,the americans have to put away their free  market fetishism for a while and find ways of creating jobs and pumping money into iraqi households.

jeff

and i gave it all my heart, all my energy, based upon principles that did not change once i got into the oval office.well, he launched today.we need an fdr in iraq, not a ronald reagan.

have you seen the materials from the press conference that he launched today

applause.i think this is actually a good thing  makes our proposal look like a much more preferable alternative by comparison, makes our support in the process more important, and sets harvey up as the ralph nader equivalent in the election to fix california s broken system  a potential spoiler.of course, the sooner the us soldiers can be withdrawn in favor of less  provocative local or international forces, the better.

hi.

now that s a rambling response.well, would nt you know it.getting the spanish out of iraq is nt nearly as good a rallying cry for al  qaeda in the arab world as getting the americans and british out.

i m not driving tonite, but i bet that we could hitch a ride back with anil.

and i have to wonder  did he forget that he already has a memoir called  a charge to keepi m not sure, but i think that he s got class tonite, too.the thing to keep in mind is that sunni arab nationalists and baathists and local sunni radicals are likely to remain far more dangerous to the us in iraq than al  qaeda infiltrators, and it would be dangerous to take one s eyes off the former ball.

i ll search him out before class or after that break and see if i can set it up.

that was the name of his  autobiography   ghost  written by adviser karen hughes in 1999.daily dose on enrongeorge w. bush alleged thursday that john edwards lacks the experience necessary to be president.

we are finished.

there has been random speculation about google developiong a new browser and  or acquiring firefox.i need to now get a job at house of pies bc that is the only way to pay the bills.the problem with this argument is that bush lacked the experience necessary to be president when he ran in 2000, so this sort of cheap shot just hoists him by his own petard.

the economy is down and when enron collapses, the energy industry is going to be in a world of hurt.

it is true that google has been in acquisition mode.not to mention the market is going to be flooded with enron folks.let s just remember a seminal bush moment in 1999

i have stronger will than you think.

as of january 10, 2005, my source of income changed from the mozilla foundation to google, inc. of mountain view, california.house of pies here i come.texas gov. george w. bush is enduring sharp criticism for being unable to name the leaders of four current world hot spots, but president bill clinton says bush  should, and probably will, pick up  those names.

i am sure i could have persuaded you to give me some action.

my role with firefox and the mozilla project will remain largely unchanged, i will continue doing much the same work as i have described above  with the new goal of successful 1.1, 1.5 and 2.0 releases.why is enron blowing upthe front  runner for the 2000 republican presidential nomination faltered thursday in an international affairs pop quiz posed by andy hiller, a political reporter for whdh  tv in boston.

i did nt want you to go.

i remain devoted full  time to the advancement of firefox, the mozilla platform and web browsing in general.i was just going to sleep anyway.bush

i was too tired to give you any action.

he also announced this in januaryenron is blowing up.hiller asked bush to name the leaders of chechnya, taiwan, india and pakistan.

vince,

welcome darinwe are still trying to work the pse swap transaction, now that the forex desk has been able to find a fix for cpi in the market.bush was only able to give a partial response to the query on the leader of taiwan, referring to taiwanese president lee teng  hui simply as  lee.

further to my voicemail, our colleagues in credit are calculating the reserve on the pse swap.

i just want to extend a big  welcome   to darin darin fisher who joined me at google this week.they are currently using 9.5  fixed based on the1 year implied volatility.he could not name the others.

volatility of usd  dm has been in the range of between7  and 11 .

2005 is going to rockcan one of your research staff justify a suitable 20 year volalatility number for usd  euro.can you name the general who is in charge of pakistan

ideally, we would like a fast turnaround.

darin fisher wrote this response on january 25, 2005in addition, is there someone who could consider the correlation between us cpi and the   euro exchange rate.hiller asked, inquiring about gen. pervaiz musharraf, who seized control of the country october 12.

the credit guys are currently assuming that there is no correlation and may consequently be double dipping the credit reserve on this basis too.

me and the big  ggrateful for any help or suggestions you could provide.wait, wait, is this 50 questions   asked bush.

sid

following on the heels of ben s annoucement yesterday, i thought i d post that i have joined google as well.vincent,hiller replied   no, it s four questions of four leaders in four hot spots. ...

i met you at the risk conference last week in houston.

like ben, i will still be very much involved with the mozilla project and communityi enjoyed your presentations very much.bush, in answering the question about the leader of pakistan, also said   the new pakistani general, he s just been elected  not elected, this guy took over office.

ben made another announcement on march 28, 2005andrew edisonenrongore released a statement friday taking bush to task for his comments on pakistan s recent coup.

06022001 1053 am

i want to use this opportunity to welcome brian ryner to googlei have settled the ecogas  enron  randy maffett lawsuit.i find it troubling that a candidate for president in our country  the world s oldest democracy  would characterize the military takeover as  good news,  gore said.

no need to thank me, just send me gifts.

brian has been one of the most crucial elements to the success of mozilla software over the past few years, ...seriously, i talked this morning with tom hall and we agreed that ecogas would pay him  53,000.further, i find it even more disturbing that he made these comments about a nation that just last year tested nuclear weapons  shortly after voicing his public opposition to the comprehensive test ban treaty.

hall has agreed to release enron, ecogas, maffett and every affiliate, related party and subsidiary.

great to have you on boardhe will also release any and all patent issues.a spokesman for president clinton also criticized bush s comments.

the goal is for him to move on with his life and for us to move on as well.

now, none of this has been confirmed by google at the present time, but it s an old adage that you follow the money to see who is behind something.i have asked doug daniels to prepare the settlement papers reflecting such an agreement.it is very dangerous for this country to condone the overthrow of democratically elected governments,  said david leavy, spokesman for the national security council.

please handle.

in this case, following the talent leads me to think that google will be making an announcement this year that formalizes the google  mozilla  firefox relationship.becky stephensenronnot only did bush not know who general pervez musharraf was, he seems to have confused coup  making with  taking office,  and moreover went on to suggest that the overthrow of an elected prime minister and the installation in power of the pakistan military, then the world s strongest supporter of the taliban, would bring  stability

if you have not already seen the flash movie epic, you should take a few minutes and view the future history of media as conceived by robin sloan and matt thompson, with music by aaron mcleran.richard, below is a list of oc invoices sent to you for approval on 53000.musharraf made his coup in part because of the military s anger over prime minister nawaz sharif s willingness to back down from confronting india over kashmir, so that he explicitly came to power as a warmonger.

please verify receipt at your earliest convenience.

in this movie google and amazon  googlezon  create a brave new world of media in 2008.thank you for your help in tracking these invoices.i ca nt tell you how ominous i found bush s performance in that interview.

this is one thought  provoking film.michael l. beatty  associates, pc   10461,  10469   10468 dated 52800.i still remember him stuttering about  the general,  unable to remember musharraf s name.

every move google makes brings this particular future closer.i am on board.he obviously had no idea what he was talking about, though he demonstrated a number of ill  fated instincts.

if the px comes back again, i will call their in  house attys.

just one small commment  it s not possible, as far as i know, for google to  aquire  firefox.christian yoder  enronenronxgatehe obviously liked authoritarian rule better than democracy, equating dictatorship with  stability.

they already have rights to take it, alter it, and release those changes to the world  this is what the whole open source thing is about.can you pass this along to elizabeth to ensure sanders is on board as welland, he did nt think he needed to know anything about south asia, with its nuclear giants and radical religious politics  the latter a dire security threat to the us.

we are renewing our lcs on a month to month basis for the px per sanders.

i m inclined to say that google is doing what they can to both shape and support the growth of the most popular nonmicrosoft browser out there  by taking on the leading lights in firefox development, they re ensuring the continued life of the project, and ensuring  not that i think they need to  that their voice will be heard admidst the higher echelons of the firefox development team.however, the request below is to  replenish  the cash that was drawn down ... please advise.he could nt tell when things were becoming more unstable as opposed to less.

i agree with steve s position stated in his separate email.

it s this sort of enlightened self interest that keeps large open source projects alive.do nt give these guys a penny.musharraf went on to play nuclear brinkmanship with india in 2002, risking war twice that year.

cgy

fascinating viewpoint of the future in epic.tracy, do we have concerns here.although musharraf did turn against the taliban after september 11, under extreme duress from the us, elements of his military continued to support radical islamism and have recently been implicated in assassination attempts on musharraf himself.

we pointed out to the px that there was excess credit.

thanks for the link.by using collateral to pay these bills are we not keeping required levels availablethis was the body that bush proclaimed was bringing  stability  to the region in fall of 1999.

sara,

malach, what you say makes sense.attached below is davis thames  presentation regarding the proposed project bruin.so, one answer to bush s charge about edwards is that if it had any merit, bush should have declined to run himself.

i will forward the draft bear stearns term sheet separately.

acquiring open source talent gives a company an inexpensive way of influencing and anticipating the direction an open source project will go.paulanother answer is that edwards certainly knows far more about foreign affairs now than bush did then.

team, sorry for the delay on getting this around.

it probably gives more bang for the buck than acquiring a private company and having to handle the inevitable culture clashes and process mismatches.please advise when you can meet to discuss issues related to your area.indeed, given how bush has rampaged around the world alienating allies and ignoring vital conflicts with the potential to blow back on the us, one might well argue that edwards knows more now than bush does.

thanks

the coalition decision to provoke a fight with muqtada al  sadr s movement only three months before the coalition provisional authority goes out of business has to be seen as a form of gross incompetence in governance.davisthis is what edwards  campaign literature said about his positions   edwards believes that the u.s. must be an active leader to help resolve conflicts, from reducing tensions between india and pakistan to the peace process in northern ireland.

clint

how did the cpa get to the point where it has turned even iraqi shiites, who were initially grateful for the removal of saddam hussein, against the united statesi spoke with mike collins  2037198385  phone  and 2037197031  fax   who conrfirmed to me that the cap included the remaining 2.5  million remaining shares.edwards is a strong supporter of israel, and believes that the u.s. has a vital role in promoting peace between the israelis and the palestinians.

state is the body with experience in international affairs and administration.ssfriday, june 04, 2004

sara,

the civilians in the department of defense only know how to blow things up.currently we have a blank  sample  for our paragraph 13s which are attached to our sample isdas for  a  us corporate,  b  hedge funds,  c  municipal.as the american public gradually wearies of the iraq crisis, some have begun worrying that the war could blow back on the us by creating the conditions for antiamerican terrorism.

i will extract the one for the us corporate paragraph 13 and email to your contact  first union securities.

rumsfeld, wolfowitz and feith staffed the cpa with neoconservatives, most of whom had no administrative experience, no arabic, and no respect for muslim culture  or knowledge about it .the sample includes our  caveat , so it should be fine.israel, however, is much closer to iraq and is likely to suffer from iraqi instability much more acutely than will the united states.

susan

they actively excluded state department iraq hands like tom warrick.susanironically, among the strongest proponents of war in iraq were israeli prime minister ariel sharon and his neoconservative supporters in the us.

while tanya is reviewing credit, can you please send a  blank form paragraph 13  for this master.

only recently have a few experienced state department arabists been allowed in to try to begin mopping up the mess.just our standard.have they, however, actually weakened israeli security

caveat  subject to credit review even though there are blanks.

the neocons in the cpa have all sorts of ulterior motives and social experiments they want to impose on the iraqi people, including polish  style economic shock therapy, some sort of sweetheart deal for israel, and maybe even breaking the country up into three parts.thanks.the biggest threat israel faces is not from conventional armies but from the asymmetrical tactics of palestinian national liberation movements.

sara

the washington monthly s who s who of neocons in iraq helps explain the extreme incompetence and possibly double  dealing of many in the cpa.first union securities, inc.the derailing of the oslo peace process by the hard  line policies of sharon and the palestinian intifada has encouraged suicide bombings.

hi sara,

sept. 11 commission member philip zelikow, who is close to the bush administration, admitted on sept. 10, 2002, that the ulterior motive of the bush administration for the iraq war was to  protect israel,  according to the asian times.i just wanted to follow up on whether you will have a chance to send a draft credit support annex  similar in form to the one previously executed with ena .this, in turn, has discouraged international investment in israel and has made it less likely that immigrants to the country will actually remain there.

i understand you may not have credit approval yet so perhaps we can leave the appropriate sections blank in the meantime.

i have long been a trenchant critic of the sadrists.thanks and regards,although israel withdrew from lebanese territory in may 2000, the radical lebanese shiite party, hizbullah, has not been mollified.

but they have nt been up to anything extraordinary as far as i can see in recent weeks.michael olsenenronit is estimated to have some 5,000 armed fighters, and they have pursued attacks against israeli forces to compel them to withdraw from the shebaa farms, a sliver of syrian territory that israel annexed after the 1967 war.

12072000 0229 pm

someone in the cpa sat down and thought up ways to stir them up by closing their newspaper and issuing 28 arrest warrants and taking in people like yaqubi.daren,any thorough assessment of the impact of the iraq war and its aftermath on israel s security environment must, therefore, closely examine its likely effect on the conduct of asymmetrical warfare.

i was wondering if it would be ok for me to sit in with you one day to get a general feel of your end of the process.

this is either gross incompetence or was done with dark ulterior motives that can scarcely be guessed at.pat had told me before he left that it would help me better grasp the process as a whole.although it is often alleged  without much evidence  that saddam hussein gave money to the families of palestinian suicide bombers and so encouraged asymmetrical warfare, it is not clear that he actually posed a danger to israel.

i understand the imminent cold weather is making things crazy, so now may not be the best time to be in your way.

there is a classical logical fallacy, post hoc ergo propter hoc  z happens after x, therefore z is caused by x , and i keep revising this posting this evening because i do nt want to fall into it.but let me know if i can spend a day, morning, or even just an afternoon down there with you whenever it is a good time.the palestinians who have been willing to kill themselves to end the israeli occupation of the gaza strip and the west bank were not driven by economic considerations.

i think it will help me very much in my role.

but sometimes, of course, when z happens after x it is because of x.thanks.saddam never did anything practical to help the palestinians.

mike

so i may as well just come out with it  it is pretty suspicious, given the neocon predominance in the cpa and in the upper reaches of the defense department that on april2 ap reported of muqtadathe new fixed price deal with equistar is  365013.at some points, as in the late 1980s, he reportedly made behind  the  scenes overtures to the israelis to arrive at some sort of a deal.

i have said and i repeat my expression of solidarity which hassan nasrallah called for to stand with hamas,  shiite cleric muqtada al  sadr said friday in a reference to nasrallah, the leader of the militant lebanese shiite group hezbollah.thanksby the late 1990s, iraq had no nuclear or biological weapons program, and had destroyed its chemical weapons stockpiles.

why were they suddenly acted on saturdaydthey vehemently protested the israeli assassination of sheikh ahmed yassin, the leader of hamas, last march.



i am not going unless lisa promises to get all wasted and boob out.keep up the good work.worse for israel, the assassination drew a denunciation even from the moderate and cautious grand ayatollah ali sistani, who wields enormous moral authority over iraqi shiites.



i definitely could use a drink, actually a couple would probably do better.we at home love it at  80these shiite movements had been suppressed by saddam hussein s regime, but have now organized and armed themselves.



bryan, you re in, rightkenthey have also reestablished their historical links with lebanese and iranian shiites.

these have been sold.

anybody up for happy hour after workgeoff,it is inevitable that most iraqi shiites will side with their hizbullah coreligionists against israel, and it seems likely that iraqi shiites will get rich enough from iraqi petroleum sales in the future that they will be in a good position to bankroll lebanese shiite radicals.

thanks for the pictures.

i was thinking kenneally s at around5.looks like the kids had a great timesunni arab fundamentalists deeply sympathize with the palestinians and with hamas, and those in iraq have deep historical inks with fundamentalists in jordan and palestine.

by september of that year the dow had tumbled to 744.

les spahnn   spahnnhnks.comthe dow then rallied to a high of 943 in september of 67.but they, too, failed.

by march of 68 the dow had fallen to 825, only to climb to a highly speculative peak of 985 in december of 68.

by april of 71 the dow had climbed back to 950, only to fall to 869 in february of 72.

alla big rally then took the dow  unconfirmed  to a record high of 1051 in january of 73, turning everyone bullish.according to former indian army general a s kalkat, the difficulty for kumaratunga s government lay in the fact that the ltte had become a de jure power in the north and east of the island and was running every aspect of civil administration in the areas within its control.

but by december of 73 the dow had collapsed to 788.

it is my understanding, from good sources in the gov s office that the gov will order loretta lynch to expeditiously implement the provision to suspend all parties auhtority to enter into direct access contracts.think that was bad  by december of 74 the dow had sunk to a bear market low of 577.a veteran of india s military intervention in the jaffna peninsula to help implement the 1987 indo  sri lanka peace accord  which ambitiously provided for the disarming of the formidable ltte  kalkat said the new defense deal would essentially be a reiteration of the older one minus its military commitment.

at that time, the gurus and geniuses of wall street were predicting a 250 dow and many were talking openly about the end of capitalism.

the premise with which the administartion is acting is that if they expeditiously suspend everyone s right to bilateral contracts quickly, it sets up a barrier which the direct access coalition must break through.of course, that was the bottomkalkat, who currently chairs the independent us  based international council on conflict resolution, said despite the failure of the indian army to disarm or even subdue the tigers, india remained the only power capable of influencing the course of the current peace talks.

and that s the way the greatest bear market since the depression worked its way down.

in other words the table is set.by late 1974 investors were dizzy, they were desperate, they were wrung  out, they had left wall street, many for good.the norwegians mean well but their role is limited to that of honest broker and the ltte is keenly aware that they do not have the power  unlike india  to underwrite any arrangement,  kalkat told ips in an interview.

our web address is httpwww.accenture.comthe results of the february 26th test reduces the working gas by 398,487 mmbtu.the tigers  chief ideologue, balasingham, sniffed at the proposal saying that  a solution to the ethnic conflict can not be predetermined by the resolutions or declarations of donor conferences, but has to be negotiated by the parties in conflict without the constraints of external forces.

in addition, there is a reduction of 22,101 mmbtu which is the difference between the scada values  best available  that anita showed on the february 29th storage sheet and the  official  february 29th values that gary wilson received from mips.

lenhart, matthewto summarize  enron s pad gas will now be 3,993,310 mmbtu, instead of 4,223,000 mmbtu.but there are strong hints in the country that a new indo  sri lanka defense deal could be in the making.

enron s working gas will be reduced by 420,588 mmbtu.

you guys want to watch the game at woodrow s tomorrowcall me if there are any questions.and this has already drawn protests from the tamil national alliance  tna  which was backed by the ltte in the april general elections held in sri lanka.

fyi

there will be some girls there and then we can get them to meet up with us at that garden in the heights party later that night.yeah i got yelled at also.tamils feel that the proposed defense agreement between india and sri lanka would encourage sinhala rulers to prepare for another war abandoning the current peace process,  tna member of parliament p sithamparanathan was quoted as saying in a statement.

i tried to say i was nt that drunk but z was nt having any of that conversation.

plus we can be outside watching it.she told me that after friday and saturday she felt i was slowly regressing.she added that recent visits to the island by india s top military brass including army chief general nirmal chander vij have  caused apprehension among tamils that preparations are under way for another war in the island .

then i told her i felt i should be able to screw missy just once.

this message is for the designated recipient only and may contain privileged or confidential information.she said that was ok.but kalkat pointed out that india would be ill  advised to be involved again, militarily, with sri lanka if only because it still had to consider the sentiments of 45 million ethnic tamils in the indian state of tamil nadu  separated from sri lanka s jaffna peninsula by the narrow palk straits.

did you get in as much trouble as i did this weekend  lori seems to think i need to get help  i told her it s normal to drink all day at a bar, then go to dinner where you do nt know half the people there and proceed to get extremely fucked up

08162000 1205 pmthankswhile most u.s. secretaries of state  save perhaps dean rusk  have gobbled up credit for outcomes that they had little to do with, few have been as brazen as colin powell.

i ve thought about you a few times in the last few months, did nt want to intrude upon an already bad situation with my bullshit questions.

i just wanted to send you a quick note to let you know that i m out ta herei m hearing some pretty depressing stuff from the people i know at ene.two years ago, pakistani president pervez musharraf was surprised when the leader of the main islamist alliance  maulana fazlur rahman  visited india and issued a series of highly conciliatory statements.

i wish i had the capital to open my own shop

today is my last day in the office here at azurix, and in the coming months, i will start in a new position as svp in the lng development group at el paso energy.there will be talent and opportunity a plenty on the market soon.as pakistan s president had been telling the united states he was  forced  into taking a hawkish line on india precisely by the likes of rahman, this was an embarrassment.

i ll ask around

this happened very quickly, and i wanted to make sure that i let everyone know before i left.i ve got some friends at duke and dynegy from b  school, the gianoucous  spelling   brothers  john and dimitri  from elementary school  started their own outfit a while back, and my old man is at schlumberger and has good contacts in general  if you are nt married to a trading environment .the reality is that india is no longer the enemy of choice for the people of pakistan.

give me a few days, and i ll be in touch.

i do nt have any contact information yet for my new job, but if you want to reach me, you can do so at robbrnglsnaol.com or at 7136647478.michaelthat distinction has now gone to the united states.

rodgers

take care.as we discussed, here is a first effort at a revised tva offer letter.india keeps what it has while pakistan and china  which was gifted a slice of the territory three decades ago  do likewise.

i drafted the into tva option as a series of calls tied to the mopa delivery term and quantity  not sure if this anything close to what you all had in mind.

rob bryngelsonplease let me know what shape you all think the offer ought to take and we can revise accordingly.simultaneously, new delhi would ensure a degree of autonomy for the state that would help cut popular support off from jihadis attempting to convert kashmir into a second afghanistan.

thanks

ps  there is a happy hour tonight at scudeiros on dallas street  just west of the met garage  beginning around 500.elizabeth 36349bill clinton understood this at the end of his term in office yet, under colin powell  who appears to have an affinity for generals active in politics , the pendulum of u.s. policy has once again swung toward a quixotic effort to prize at least the valley of kashmir loose from india.

will you be providing an execution version with questions removed  blanks filled in11152000 1158 amthe u.s. state department and the misnamed think tanks that follow its lead have held numerous conferences on kashmir and, in most of them, the solution that has emerged is a valley prized loose from indian control and under its own version of ibrahim rugova.

attached are clean and blacklined drafts of the enron guaranties to be made in support of epmi s obligations under the indian mesa ii renewable energy purchase agreement   ppa   and green premium sharing agreement   gspa  .

please send it directly to kent.shoemakerae.ge.com, copy to me.the guaranty for the ppa is blacklined against the enron epc contract guaranty in favor of the banks which was granted in connection with our cabazon wind power project  the project most recently financed by ewc  and the gpsa guaranty is blacklined against the ppa guaranty.that india is not yugoslavia and that the  foreigner  led  indian national congress can least afford to ignore indian nationalism, has not struck the conferees, among whom have been several indian  scholars  and  analysts  ready to say and endorse anything for the sake of a free trip to new york or vienna.

as we discussed last week, since the enron guaranties will need to be in a form that will acceptable to our project lenders and equity participants, we thought that we should start with a form that was used in our last financing and that was negotiated by enron and the banks.

thanks,we plan to use the same basic form for the enron guaranty that will be made in favor of epmi with respect to the seller s obligations under the ppa.despite many wrinkles, india remains a part  democracy and merely signing on to a piece of paper that calls for an independent kashmir does not get you into the trouble that writing an op  ed piece against sonia gandhi or atal behari vajpayee would instantly.

we will forward the draft of that guaranty to you later today.

thanks,please feel free to give me a call if you have any questions concerning the attached guaranties.it was the business community in india that stepped in after vajpayee indulged in an empty bout of saber rattling in 2002, pointing out that the only beneficiary of the mythical perception that war  especially nuclear war  was around the corner in the subcontinent was china.

thank you.

kayppa guaranty.docthe reason for this is that india is emerging as an alternative investment destination to china, hence the favor that the generals in islamabad do to their trusty supplier of nukes and missiles by creating a scare about war involving india when in fact the real flashpoints are the taiwan straits and north korea.

we still have the traders and books that you provided last week, but need to know if there are any changes to this.

on or about september 23, 1999 a request for service was placed by the above referenced counterparty.please let us know if you need a change so that the deals will bridge with the correct books.requests like that were nt unusual, says retired col. william campenni, who flew with bush in 1970 and 1971.

thanks,

the request was for a intrastate gas transportation agreement and 311 gas transportation agreement.dawnin 1972, there was an enormous glut of pilots,  campenni says.

hey,

these agreements were forwarded to the counterparty, ccng, inc..i am going to have to miss your wedding.the vietnam war was winding down, and the air force was putting pilots in desk jobs.

unfortunately, i will be in plano that weekend.

on or about october6, 1999, kelly cloud, senior vice president of ccng, inc.  713  2351972, called and informed me that the counterparty should be ccgm, l.p..i wish i could make it.in 72 or 73, if you were a pilot, active or guard, and you had an obligation and wanted to get out, no problem.

what s going on with the ubs weather position

further, she informed me that section7 of the agreement, which reads in part  gas is free from liens and adverse claims of every kind, should be changed because the gas that the counterparty will be transporting on hpl may and  or is subject to liens.has that gone anywhere or are the other possibilities you had betterin fact, you were helping them solve their problem.

talk to you soon,

she was instructed to destroy the agreement and another would be forwarded to her with the necessary corrections and rewording of section7.kamso bush stopped flying.

hey guys,

attached find the agreements for the necessary changes in section7.i am being told by my better half that we need to get an accurate head count of who will be attending our wedding.from may 1972 to may 1973, he earned just 56 points  not much, but enough to meet his requirement.

if you would be so kind, could you possibly let me know of your status over the next couple of days

kellyfor those of you who already sent us an rsvp response recently, please disregard.then, in 1973, as bush made plans to leave the guard and go to harvard business school, he again started showing up frequently.

thanks for your help

cloud has instructed me to call with any further questions.jeffin june and july of 1973, he accumulated 56 points, enough to meet the minimum requirement for the 1973  1974 year.

there are deals in the aruba book so i m not sure why you are nt picking those up.

townsend, george   gtownsendmanorisd.netas seen below,democrats are spitting mad over attacks on john kerry s record by the group swift boat veterans for truth.

please start using the ena dpr 0102 file rather than the ews dpr 2002 file to send to chris.

03272001 0911 amthe positions needed to be divided to reflect bcf s.and, as it is with kerry, it s reasonable to look at a candidate s entire record, including his military service  or lack of it.

thanks

puto,kamvoters are perfectly able to decide whether it s important or not in november.

could you also cc me the first few times you send it

what s going on dudewhile our established schedules of tuesday and friday dprs would have us reporting tomorrow s activity on monday, we will change that for month end.the kerry camp blames bush for the swift boat veterans  attack, but anyone who has spent much time talking to the swifties gets the sense that they are doing it entirely for their own reasons.

please email the january 31st dpr information for your respective groups to my attention by noon on friday.

antigua was awesome.you should use the same spreadsheet format used for the 12902 dpr.and it should be noted in passing that kerry has personally questioned bush s service, while bush has not personally questioned kerry s.

all pl and prma numbers should be in  000s.

i survived it without a problem.starting in february, you will be able to export the data, as opposed to using the spreadsheets.in april  before the swift boat veterans had said a word  kerry said bush  has yet to explain to america whether or not, and tell the truth, about whether he showed up for duty.

thanks,

heather moving in has been a different story.chris abel manager, risk controls global risk operations chris.abelenron.com  mailtochris.abelenron.com  713.853.3102earlier, kerry said,  just because you get an honorable discharge does not, in fact, answer that question.

kristen,

i did nt realize how much  stuff  you could pack into a one bedroom apartment.attached are all live financial deals by risk type.now, after the swift boat episode, the spotlight has returned to bush.

as you can see, the price data is too large to fit into one tab.

how is your love life.after tomorrow, i will no longer have access to the estate files.that s fine.

greg couch will be taking over the responsibility for the estate risk group and will be able to assist you with your requests going forward.

the gal from the wedding was pretty hot.thankswe should know as much as we can.

are you still chasing thated,and perhaps someday kerry will release more of his military records as well.

here is a list of the risk people that will be with the estate.

let s get together soon.after this weekend, we will no longer have access to the estate files, these people will be able to help you with any of your questions.byron york is a white house correspondent for national review.

inhibitory systems are essential for controlling the pattern of activity in the cortex, which has important implications for the mechanisms of cortical operation, according to a yale school of medicine study in neuron ....

the weather is going to be fine, hector was just blowing smoke.the findings demonstrate the inhibitory network is central to controlling not only the amplitude, extent and duration of activation of recurrent excitatory cortical networks, but also the precise timing of action potentials, and, thus, network synchronization ...but i also see that as a fatal misconception, which is doing sunnis harm, because i do nt believe the us is going anywhere so soon.

have you heard from anyonewashington, d.c.i would suggest going for tribal sheikhs rather than clerics, since they have the upper hand in their areas and can effectively root out any baathists in their midst in return for a promise of sharing power and authority.

the overwhelming human and financial impacts of hurricane katrina are powerful evidence that political and economic decisions made in the united states and other countries have failed to account for our dependence on a healthy resource base, according to an assessment released today by the worldwatch institute.

also, what s the deal with the weather this weekendalteration of the mississippi river and the destruction of wetlands at its mouth have left the area around new orleans abnormally vulnerable to the forces of nature.many of these sheikhs have been disenfranchised and abused over the last two years.

according to many scientists, the early results of global warming  90 degree fahrenheit water temperatures in the gulf and rising sea levels  may have exacerbated the destructive power of katrina.

glad to hear all is well.with protests going on in the chilean capital of santiago  from the economic summit , president bush visited chinese president hu jintao and other key allies in santiago.the shia can not live without the sunnis, and vice versa.

the talk of the day besides a more level playing field with china was north korea.

i meant to comment that i thought the people profiled in the article should pull their heads out of their self important asses.china has been a great help at getting north korea to the table and bush is hoping that with their cooperation korea can become a nuclear free peninsula.both have shared this country for the last 14 centuries and there is no possible way that one can live without the other.

wei s magic cubes

catriona is well and has landed herself a pretty cool job in pr.wei ligang, a rising star of modern art in china, just had an exhibition in midjuly, 2005 in hong kong.the bombings implicated muslims, and exacerbated regional tensions which the bush regime and its friends wearing the brass in the philippine military sought to exploit.

he is now lecturing in usa.

keep in touch,his art perfectly combines painting and chinese calligraphy.posada s crimes, on the other hand, must seem like ancient history, especially to a people who do nt know their history.

he is regarded as one of the leading avant  garde artist of modern calligraphy.

mikehis artworks were selected and exhibited in british museum in 2002.and to those who do nt even know their crimes, not even that.

wei has given some virtuoso performances with brush and ink, often incorporating several different techniques into a single work,  said gordon s. barrass, curator of the exhibition.

michael j. mcdermott mjmcdermotthotmail.comin the world of  wei s magic cubes,  all seem to be ingeniously planned and tricky.but will posada be given up

all are mathematical, all are linguistic.

in wei s art, a logician could see mathematical logic, a cellist could see a ripple of nine bass notes, a country girl could see straw, and harry potter could see two accompanied green blazes.i doubt he will be extradited to venezuela, which is the only way that question could be answered with a yes.

it looks like the war between microsoft and google is quickly brewing on the horizon.

work hard and retire early.microsoft is4 0  they took down netscape, suns systems, mac and ibm  and google may be their next target.but posada s nearly 80 years old, and the venezuelan people will ensure that s a vain hope.

google is probably making this move to counter microsoft search using encarta  its online dictionary .

but it looks like google is nt opening its mouth about the reason behind the offer as linux news reports

chriswhile we do nt have anything specific to announce today, google and the wikimedia foundation are collaboratively evaluating creative ways to support wikipedia.org and its community.an embarrassment to the us still, just not as embarrassing as having the old killer strut about miami, gloating in his freedom.

let s discuss next time we have amstel lights together.action network is a bbc website for people who are taking action on issues that concern them.another connection to philippine terror and weapons smuggling  dating from the 1980s  is alleged in the book disposable patriot, by jack terrell.

i m getting in touch because i think it could be useful to people campaigning about hospital closures.

jolene harveywe ve got a page dedicated to issues around hospitals  httpwww.bbc.co.ukdnaactionnetworkc55153  and a group called nhs sos have already put up a campaign about ward closures in cumbria.terrell, a cia asset originally recruited for the contra effort, identifies the man attempting to recruit him into the philippine scheme as oliver north ...

i m hoping to build this up to be a hub for all the campaigners  a place where people can exchange ideas and advice.

05222001 0925 amit would be great if the person from chant who started this page would put up a short description of the campaign and a list to this group page on the action network site.i seem to recall the object was to smuggle explosives.

action network is also a good place to post details of events, or try to rally together a group if you want to take action in your area.

i m more than happy to help people with the site or answer any questions about action network  just drop me a message.

see attached file  text.htmotherwise, hope to see you therei ve read the book  it s a first person memoir with the ring of truth, especially since so much of the wider context has confirmed the allegations of contra drug connections that led to terrell becoming a target for discrediting by the twig counterintelligence group that ran interference for the contra effort, staffed by covert ops types including ollie north, robert owen, vince cannistaro and buck revell.

thank you.the room is silent, none of the other children volunteer.wilson was claiming that he had been working for the cia when he sold the c 4 to quaddaffi.

it looks like the lunar transportation systems, inc. is visualizing a  space highway  going from the moon to earth  and back again .

not sure if i am going to buy 17  or 16  wheels for the winter.our new lunar transportation system utilizes a unique architecture that will establish the equivalent of a two  way highway between the earth and the moon,  kistler told space.com.httpwww.disinfo.comarchivepagesdossierid334pg1

our plans include raising private capital to develop, build, flight test, and operate this earth  moon highway for the benefit of the country and the benefit of our investors.

jackass.wise decision to go through the private sector  nasa s budget may be kinda tight to fund a project like this.last week, federal district judge lynn hughes in huston, texas, threw out wilson s two  decades old conviction.

this group does sound pretty interesting though.

you have always been on the move seeking affectionate, satisfying and harmonious relationships.the lunar transporatation systems  lts  is actually being funded by two space businessmen, walter kistler and bob citron.judge hughes wrote   government knowingly used false evidence against him,  concluding  honesty comes hard to government.

both of these men are heavily involved in the private sector of the space industry, and both are also involved with another space company called spacehab.

your ultimate goal has been the realisation of an intimate union in which there could be love, self  sacrifice and mutual trust.they want to use lts to tie into nasa s vision for space exploration, and seem pleased that the white house is moving in that direction.httpwww.bigeye.com111003.htm

we are so excited that the white house and the recent new government space policy underscores the need to involve the private sector in assisting nasa develop its plans for the new vision for space exploration,  said walter kistler, lts cofounder and chairman.

it has often been said that  true love is just around the corner  ... and maybe ... if you have nt found it as yet  you possibly soon will.with their proposal of a  earth  moon  highway, it looks like space tourism may become a reality sooner than we think.httpwww.thekcrachannel.comnews4503872detail.html

space.com

you wear your heart on your sleeve ... and since you are an emotional person you are apt to give your all ... heart and soul ... to all those that show you a little affection ... but take care ... it would appear that you have been extremely hurt in the past ... and you keep leaving yourself wide open for punishment ..u.s. astronauts will launch to the moon on sleek, single, shuttle booster rockets and the first new upper  stage rocket this country has developed in more than a decade, nasa and the pentagon have told the white house.ponchatoula, la.

lunar landers and other gear needed for extended visits to the moon will be lofted by gargantuan launchers as big as the apollo  era saturn5, the most powerful rockets ever flown.

whatever you strive to do, something always seems to be holding you back.it looks as if nasa is transitioning away from the shuttle model, as in the past they have proven to be quite dangerous as columbia has recently proved.sheriff s deputies in louisiana made a third arrest wednesday in the ongoing investigation of a case involving allegations of sexual abuse of children and animals at a ponchatoula, la., church.

although these new rockets are probably more expensive, they will be able to go at a much greater range than its shuttle cousins, as they can not only break free from the atmosphere but reach the moon as well.

there is no subterfuge in you.nasa will initiate development of a crew launch vehicle derived from space shuttle solid rocket boosters with a new upper stage for human spaceflight,  said the letter, signed by nasa administrator mike griffin and the pentagon s top space official, exastronaut ron sega ...austin aaron bernard iii, 36, was arrested on a charge of aggravated rape of a child under the age of 13.

nasa then plans to develop a new 100  metric  ton  class launch vehicle derived from existing capabilities with the space shuttle external tanks and solid rocket boosters for future missions to the moon,  the letter said.

you are a clear thinker and all you demand from life, in a relationship, is a partner whom you can trust and with whom you can, together, develop a foundation of trust based on understanding.nasa is planning on using these new shuttles to replace the current models, with industry forecasters predicting a launch as early as 2014.police said bernard confessed to detectives that he had sex with a young girl in november 2002 and admitted to knowing about sexual acts involving children and a dog that occurred at hosanna church.

the new rocket design will differ slightly from its predecessors, in the fact that the crew and cargo would launch separately from two different rockets each and join up in space later on.

you are your own person ... and you demand freedom of thought ... to follow your own convictions.launching this way will hopefully avoid future disasters, giving more support towards nasa revisiting the stars.tangipahoa parish sheriff s deputy christopher blair labat, 24, was booked tuesday on one count of aggravated rape and one count of crime against nature.

make a mold.

could this be what you r referencingcast.with growing economic and military power, india will be dependent on smaller nations in the region increasingly to maintain regional security.

depending on scale, just buy a fish and make a mold from that

debra perlingierewithout a doubt ..... baconin fact, it would tend to encourage more organized antiindia outfits, such as the pakistani inter services intelligence  isi  and outside  linked maoists, to exploit these networks and weaken india s eastern flank.

thick cut bacon or really good sausages

rudwell 53596.i ve been looking at the bose sound dock 10 i ve currently got a jvc mini hifi system, i was wondering what would be a good set of speakers.on south andaman, the most heavily populated island, is port blair, which is the capital and the only large town in the entire archipelago.

i like music very loud and with a lot of bass.

cindy,also i was wondering, is it true that the bigger the speakers are the better.travel to the nicobar islands is forbidden to nonindians, and they are also not allowed in some parts of south andaman island.

thanks

debra perlingiereit s a gift from my brother.islamabad accuses new delhi of using its consulates in kandahar and jalalabad to train balochi insurgents who are active in pakistani balochistan.

why will hav to pay customs if it is a gift ...

they are taking delivery in the u.s.i always thought there s no custom charges for gifts.pakistani officials claim there are as many as 42 raw agents based in kandahar and another 12 in jalalabad.

yup.

hahaha

i used to email vince kaminski about the advice on his article  the challenge of pricing and risk managing electricity derivatives  and he had mailed me the copy.not sure yetthe elections should be a reassurance to all our neighbours that a stable afghanistan, a peaceful afghanistan is good for all.

i am now modelling the queensland electricity spot price using geometric brownian mean reverting jump diffusion model and have followed your paper  making the most of mean reversion  to estimate the mean reversion speed.maybe labour.nobody should feel a looser in afghanistan,  president hamid karzai told pakistan s english daily the nation.

i do see myself as a conservative

however, the result from ordinary least squares was not as expected due to different sign for both slope  intercept.arriving in auckland on a direct flight from canada.since september 11, pakistan has been repeatedly accused by afghan and western leaders of harbouring taliban extremists who had pledged to disrupt the elections, but at the highest level the us has avoided criticising president pervaiz musharraf on the grounds that he is helping the us catch al qaeda elements inside pakistan.

vinceout of carnival, royal caribbean, and norweigan  cruises  which is the best and whythe next day an angry musharraf categorically said that pakistan would not send pakistani troops to iraq, a clear snub to the americans.

i prefer royal caribbean out of all these.

traci,there is so much to do onboard.until then he had said pakistan s options were open.

the new ncl epic does sound amazing, although i have nt sailed on her yet.

thanks.none of the above.however pakistani officials insist that the decision was unconnected to the tripartite meeting.

of these three, it s a toss  up between royal and carnival.

this is the best solution given all the uncertainties we face.ncl is a notch below either, in terms of quality and service.us and nato military officers in kabul say it is too early to say whether bush s tough message was instrumental in persuading musharraf and the isi to pressure the taliban to restrain from disrupting the elections.

vincemine does.however there were visible signs of a crackdown on the pakistan side.

i have the htc evo.

vincedepends on the computerpakistan now has a large force deployed in baluchistan which was not there before,  says lt. general david barno.

if the computer is completely shut off, the usb ports are nt getting power, so they wo nt charge your phone

thanks for the message regarding a possible intern for your group.many pcs have sleep  charge now, that allow the pc to go into sleep mode, and still allow the usb ports to charge things like phones.there is much better tactical cooperation between our forces on both sides of the border, but the movement of taliban still goes on both ways,  he adds.

what is a good slogan for an argentinian restaurant

right now, we are in the process of evaluating both our new hire needs and our summer needs and will be making those decisions after the first of the year.in argentina, beef is revered, respected, and praised.also several days before the elections pakistan closed the border crossing point at chaman in baluchistan which is a key entry point for the taliban into afghanistan.

come see how we continue this tradition.

until we have come up with those numbers it would be premature to make any offers for the summer.a taste of argentina.however us military officers say regular army officers  many of them pashtun  leading units of the frontier corps who are on the border remain deeply sympathetic to the taliban and the mullahs of the jui.

here are some articles that discuss the details of slogan writing.

what i would like to do in this case is get the information to jeff davis, who is responsible for georgia tech and ask him to get sungjoo s resume and start a file on him with a notation that you would like to hire him for summer.why certain slogans work and why some do nt.at the same time the us remains oblivious of the serious problems and political fallout which the army is facing in its operations in waziristan.

you will find these helpful in writing a new slogan.

when we start the summer process, we will interview the candidate and slot him for your group.a look at slogans  httpwww.smallbusinesssoftware.netlookatslogans.htmnot only is the army facing serious political fallout, growing antiamericanism and antiarmy feeling in the tribal areas but it is also taking heavy casualties  between 400  500 pakistani soldiers have been killed in the region since march.

have a look at sony wx10

traci,i need creative art ideaswith the taliban failure to disrupt the afghan elections, the militants are even more isolated from the mainstream taliban who want to return home.

what are some cool ideas for making a postor usint the word mad on a white paper in a weird or artsy way

i have visited georgia tech on thursday.the actual word  mad  has to be on the cover and incorporated into the image.until now pakistan has not facilitated such a return and clearly it can not happen until there is both a pull from kabul and a push from islamabad.

mad means crazy, or angry, so you do a lot with it, i would put a gorrilla screaming, just the face, and just throw in a lot of brushes fifferent colors, make it look artistic.

one of the students indicated that he is interested in a summer internship.use photoshop.with president karzai certain to win the elections and the demotion of key former northern alliance figures such as general fahim and warlord ismail khan, there is now little reason for moderate taliban leaders to fear reprisals from former northern alliance figures if they return home.

tttthhhhh madonna

he came across as a very bright person, very personable.what is the fall of hanoitheir removal should also provide increased motivation for pakistan to help the return of moderate taliban.

can anyone tell me exactly what it is and what took place

i can take him as a summer intern.i ca nt find any information about itafghan officials welcomed the appointment on october3 of lt. general ashfaq kiyani as the new isi chief.

when the french returned to indochina at the end of ww ii the viet minh were in control of the red river delta.

is that what you are referring to

dear dr. vincent kaminski,you need to check out the french indochina war  1946  1954  not the vietnam war  1957  1975 .karzai also has to deal with the stepped up rivalry between india and pakistan in afghanistan.

depends of what.

renee,ounces measure weight, pints measure volume.we have a very small number of forces in shindand with a few helicopters,  says barno.

if you mean fluid ounces, 20, as opposed to the 16 in america.

i would like to have a meeting to go over the payment methodology.an irish pint is larger than a us one.nevertheless this places karzai in a difficult and sensitive situation because he has to maintain excellent relations with both the us and iran.

20 fluid ounces in a pint in ireland

scott neal and tom martin would like to attend as well.as r  g said, there are only 16 in an american one.afghanistan has had the benefit of cooperation from both the us and iran.

this afternoon at2 pm or later would work for us.that place did nt stay open too long dso far what they have done together has been good for us and that s how we would like to keep it , says karzai.

need help finding irish music

please let me know what time we could meet.i love the script and know the re from iraland.nobody can claim that the interference of afghanistan s neighbours is over, but the elections will do much to strengthen karzai and deal more firmly with neighbours  interference.

i would like more bands like them pleasseee

thank you,the thing about the script is they do not sound that irish, i was surprised to hear they were from dublin.in the post election scenario it is becoming abundantly clear that the taliban do not have the support of the afghan people nor the afghan pashtuns.

well if you are interested, i suggest you have a look at general fiasco, two door cinema club and wallis bird.

phillipi think you will be pleased.in a highly significant move afghan pashtun tribes along the pakistan border warned the taliban in quetta and chaman that if they try and disrupt the elections, they would be resisted.

i doubt you will get a sensible answer in the  travel  section.

phillip,irelandmany taliban living in afghanistan voted for president karzai.

and there s nothing distinctly irish about them.

this section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event.you d find similar bands to them that are from the uk and us.it is now abundantly clear that with the rapidly changing face of afghanistan, the demise of key northern alliance figures and the fluid political situation in afghanistan, pakistan should reconsider its policy of giving unlimited sanctuary to taliban extremists living on pakistani soil.

women s rain coat ... where can i find one

the way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent.i m going on a trip to europe soon, and i need to find a good, quality raincoat.pakistan link 16102004

i ve looked and looked, but can not find one anywhere

as such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent.i would prefer a simple, fitted black one.the debate that a handful of texas multimillionnaires close to the bush family have cleverly manufactured over john kerry s war record is absurd in every way.

it actually needs to be relatively waterproof  the last one i bought had me soaked in anything more than light  moderate rain.

we will be distributing the shares reflected on your 93001 statement  6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares .i ll pay up to 200  250 for it if i have to.the charges that they have put some vets up to making against kerry are false and can be demonstrated by the historical record to be false.

look on the debenhams website

if you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares.in the craghoppers sectionmost of those making the charges have even flip  flopped, contradicting themselves.

as you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from ntrc to hewitt.i have a kodak camera  10.2 megapixels  ... kodak af 5x optical lens ... how do i pause it while recordingbut to address the substance of this big lie is to risk falling into its logic.

i have a kodak camera  10.2 megapixels  ... kodak af 5x optical lens ... how do i pause it while recording

as such, we have a cpa, larry lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files.you do nt ... there s no such thing as  pause  in digital recording.the true absurdity of the entire situation is easily appreciated when we consider that george w. bush never showed any bravery at all at any point in his life.

that s because of the buffer that holds the data until it s ready to be recorded to the memory card.

he has become our department expert on the psa account  much more knowledgeable than myself  and the various plan provision amendments.when you press the button to stop recording the data is moved from the buffer to the memory card  no pause.he has never lived in a war zone.

all you can do is take each section  individual video  and edit them together on software.

if you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and larry to go over the payment methodology.i have a nacho libre question.if some of john kerry s wounds were superficial, bush received no wounds.

when nacho is driving to cure the influenza guy does he say to the man with the cow i like your blouse or i like your cow because my friend thinks he says i like your blouse, but that would nt make sense.

please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you.i know it s in the wrong catagory, but still, i wrote this question for a reason, not for you to critisize me.and, a piece of shrapnel in the forearm that caused only a minor wound would have killed had it hit an eye and gone into the brain  the shrapnel being in your body demonstrates you were in mortal danger and did nt absent yourself from it.

why are there two statues of david

attendees  pam butleri doing a research paper on donatello and i notice that there are two statues of david, a bronze one and marble one.but he suffers the severe effects of the aftermath, and we are all suffering along with him now, since he is the most powerful man in the world.

michelangelo made the marble one but why did he do another if donatello had already made one

renee ratcliffso i m a little confused, why is there two statues of davidwe all know by now that bush did not even do his full service with the texas air national guard, absenting himself to work on the alabama senate campaign of winton  red  blount.

different generations, the donatello is of a boy david as a young sheep herder, the michelangelo is the grown up man david as slayer and king

larry lewisbecause he liked making statues of david  dwhether he was actually awol during this stint is unclear.

obviously, he should have been arrested and jailed  imagine making a statue or painting on the same subject as another artist  clearly insulting and disrespecting  wasted time that could have been used making a statue with clothes on.

tom martinname of specific hibachi restaurant in chicagobut it is clear that not only did bush slack off on his national guard service, but he slacked off from his campaign work.

i have a friend out in chicago this week, and i am trying to remember the name of an awesome hibachi style restaurant i visited while out there a couple years ago.

scott neali think it was in the lincoln square area but do nt quote me on that.this little  noted interview with blount s nephew murph archibald, which appeared on national public radio s  all things considered on march 30, 2004, gives a devastating insight into what it was like to have to suffer through bush in that period.

its  gimmick  was that you fill your bowl cafeteria  style from raw ingredients and leave it on the counter with a chopstick listing your table number on it.

phillip allenfour guys around a large square open hibachi cook your food, and when it s finished a server brings it to your table.all things considered  800 pm et   npr march 30, 2004 tuesday

all  you can  eat style deal.

greg,it was pretty epic as i remember and would love to send my friend there.this campaign season, there have been questions about whether george w. bush fulfilled his obligations to the national guard as a young lieutenant in the early 1970s.

any help

i faxed you the promotional on 10300 heritage office building with the nimitz post office.that is flat top grillfor weeks, reporters scoured alabama in search of pilots or anyone who might have remembered seeing mr. bush at the time he was serving in the national guard there.

what s the best time to start a trip around the world

the broker called back shortly after i spoke to you to let me know that the kestrel air park building and the strip center at fm78  walzem had both sold.well, i m about to graduate in less then a year, and i m planning to study medical school.there is one place in alabama where mr. bush was present nearly every day  the headquarters in montgomery of us senate candidate winton  red  blount.

but since in my country it lasts for minimum6 years, and i want to go aground the world, what do you think, should i do it before or after medical school

let me know what you think of this property.if you can afford to go before, then by all means, go.president bush has always said that working for blount was the reason he transferred to the alabama air national guard.

if you have to wait, due to financial reasons, then wait.

also, let me know of any other ideas about replacement property.i would much rather put it off until i can afford to have the vacation of a lifetime as i m sure this trip is intended to be.npr s wade goodwyn has this report about mr. bush s time on that campaign.

airfare alone will be incredibly expensive so make sure you have the money and of course free time to take your time and have a great time.

phillipcanon t2i stops workingwade goodwyn reporting

my canon t2i stops working at times as in the power bottom is switched to  on  but the camera does not respond to any function.

jim,the camera only begins to work again when i take out the battery and put it back in.in 1972, baba groom was a smart, funny young woman smack  dab in the middle of an exciting us senate campaign.

did anyone have this issue

take a look at this spreadsheet.is it worthy to send in for warranty repairgroom was republican red blount s scheduler, and in that job, she was the hub in the campaign wheel.

thanks

i tried to calculate the irr on the port aransas and roma post offices.sounds simple enough to me.ask her about the handsome young man from texas, and she remembers him 32 years later like it was yesterday.

your camera is nt acting normally, you got warranty, let canon deal with it.

is this how your clients usually evaluate these propertiesi would agree.ms. baba groom  former campaign worker

i shoot a t1i and have nt had such an issue.

the roma deal looks much better.i also agree it s under warranty so get in touch with canon.he would wear khaki trousers and some old jacket.

it sounds like a firmware issue and the camera requires a reboot just like what happens in a computer  needs a restart from time to time but it should nt be happening in a camera.

phillipcall canonhe was always ready to go out on the road.

cheapest airline ticket from raleigh to philippines

mery,i m going on a vacation to the philippines in may 2012, and i m starting from raleigh, nc  rdu airport .on the phone, you could hear his accent.

which airlines should i look into and when should i buy my ticket

this sounds better than the limitations you were describing in the meeting.the sooner the better but i d probably wait until after the holidays.it was a texas accent.

use travelocity or expedia and see what you come up with.

we should be able to work with this.my friend goes to the phils every6 months or so and she has found that korean air has had the cheapest fares lately.but he just melded with everybody.

ask a travel agent

hope you enjoy the posts and feel free to jump in anywhere.on my last6 trips here from the states i used  fly genesis  based in seattle, wa.prominent southern republicans were something of a rare breed in those days.

they gave the best service  rates i could find.

hope to see you soonwhat is the best place to get discounts for san francisco restaurantsblount s support of the party led him to be appointed richard nixon s postmaster general.

i just moved into the city, and i m wondering if there s a place i can get good deals on restaurants here.

the alaskan knighti do nt want to have to deal with those deal  a  day websites like groupon.in washington, blount became friends and tennis partners with mr. bush s father, then congressman bush.

i just want a simple way to get a good deal to whatever restaurant i want, whenever i want.

all you have to do is sign up for one free offer  such as efax  and then cancel within the offer time frame.any suggestions would be really helpful, thanksthat was how 26  year  old lieutenant bush came to montgomery, at his father s urging...

i usually use zebraklub.

absolutely free.they basically buy daily deals from groupon, living social, and all sorts of other places.it was mr. bush s job to organize the republican county chairpersons in the 67 alabama counties.

so you can pretty much get whatever deal you want anytime.

email  franz371...gmail.commost of the deals let you eat for 500 ff, and some of the deals are even free.back in 1972 in the deep south, many rural counties did nt have much in the way of official republican party apparatus.

if you want to eat cheaply without worrying about all those daily deal emails every day, zebraklub should be perfect for you.

site madewhere can i go on a first date  adultsbut throughout alabama, there were republicans and democrats who wanted to help red blount.

looking for something on the casual side and we want it to be fun.

and it seems this is the first site of ragnarok2 hahaha since the site is new send me your suggestions and commentsmay seem a little silly, but, taking a long ride on the metra system or the  l  system is a great way to see the city and sites without spending a fortune.it was the young texan s job to find out what each county leader needed in the way of campaign supplies and get those supplies to them.

or how about visiting the chicago botanical gardens and see the change of colors and enjoy the air, they also have many inside exhibits you might enjoy, food is pretty good to.

i was thinking cichlids

i took a tip from carri and looked up rat asciis on google.possibly a freshwater tank with a ton of different species in there.ordinarily, george would come in around noon  he would ordinarily leave around 530 or 600 in the evening.

i ve never kept cichlids though.

check these outi know saltwater is a possibility, can you give me a possible stocking option for that toogoodwyn  archibald says that two months before the election, in september of 72, red blount s campaign manager came to him and asked that he quietly take over mr. bush s job because the campaign materials were not getting out to the counties.

i ll choose the one that sounds the best after looking into all the fish

... there is no companion quite so devoted, so communicative, so loving and so mesmerizing as a rat.here is the stocking for my 150 gallon tank i upgraded it to 200 at the weekend because of the clownloach a 200 gallon with6 pairs of breeding angel fish fire mouth honey gouramis58 inch clownloach a krib and51 inch clown loach with 16 cory cats5 australian rainbowsmr. archibald  george certainly did nt seem to have any concerns about my taking over this work with the campaign workers there.

if you took out the clown loach it would make a nice 150 gallon tank.

cgoehringfill it with water  lolmy overall impression was that he did nt seem as interested in the campaign as the other people who were working at the state headquarters.

for a tank that size i would suggest oscars or piranha every time awesome fish

hello dear list members,a thoroughly comprehensive service  excellent communication and best of they are transparent with their fee  ie nothing is simply implied or assumed .an editorial in the church  owned deseret morning news in salt lake city earlier this year acknowledged that  the state s history, a conservative belief in free choice, and an unwillingness to stir up a hornet s nest in the national media have likely all contributed to the kid  glove approach lawmakers and law  enforcement officers have taken when dealing with polygamous communities.

i gave dr. rohatgi2 stars because her assistant was very pleasant.

way to go

cheap air tickets for corporateterrible customer serviceand mek  the iranian  not iraqi  terror group in question  is itself unquestionably a cult

fried rice has no flavor, it literally taste like water.

some of the corporate also get cheap air tickets because they tie up with some of the airlines for a certain period based on the discount and services they get from the airlines.when i tried to return it they refused, so i had to leave without a refund and still hungry.as the leaders like to boast, the mujahedeen is a family affair.

wow, the representative went way above and beyond in helping me with my account set up.

corporate plans are clubbed with other services through some agencies to provide better service for their staff.i wish the other utilities i had to set up had people to work with like this ..we have three generations of martyrs  grandmothers, mothers, daughters.

bad service

promotional discount airfaredefinately wo nt be returning.most of the girls i was meeting had grown up in mujahedeen schools in ashraf, where they lived separated from their parents.

travelled 40 mins after calling to see if a product was in stock.

some countries like malaysia and singapore promote trading for foreign visitors during some part of the year.told that they had plenty.family visits were allowed on thursday nights and fridays.

get there and there was nothing.

during this period, they offer cheap air tickets to their country on certain flights.not impressedwhen iraq invaded kuwait, many of these girls were transported to jordan and then smuggled to various countries  germany, france, canada, denmark, england, the united states  where they were raised by guardians who were usually mujahedeen supporters.

several years ago i developed a short paper and pencil screening test which, in a small pilot study, discriminated between adhd, ld, and control subjects.very knowledgeable and friendly design build firm.every morning and night, the kids, beginning as young as1 and2, had to stand before a poster of massoud and maryam, salute them and shout praises to them,  nadereh afshari, a former mujahedeen deep  believer, told me.

they specialize in financial institutions, medical, and retail projects.

i recently converted this test to an online test in order to norm it to a larger population and, subsequently, to make it available to any one who has access to a computer and the internet.these guys know what they re doing and helped me in all phases of our project.afshari, who was posted in germany and was responsible for receiving mujahedeen children during the gulf war, said that when the german government tried to absorb mujahedeen children into their education system, the mujahedeen refused.

the waiting staff is really friendly, it s like every one knows each other, the manager is really sweet and the food .. well no complaints from me.

the test itself is what is called a substitution test.yes, it s that good.many of the children were sent to mujahedeen schools, particularly in france.

they have fresh flowers, lasted a long while in the vase, and the two ladies at the shop know the business well.

it has two parts, both of which are timed for 90 seconds each and the differential between the resulting two scores determines the likelihood of having a learning disability or attention deficit disorder.i had no problem with my delivery.the rajavis, afshari went on to say,  saw these kids as the next generation s soldiers.

i will go there again.

i am in need of test subjects and hope you will take it.out of businessthey wanted to brainwash them and control them.

i think this location is no longer in business.

the test, along with an information form, is available at .if you check recwarehouse.com, they do nt list this as a location.which may explain the pattern to their stories  a journey to self  empowerment and the enlightenment of self  sacrifice inspired by the light and wisdom of maryam and massoud.

once upon a time  in 2001, to be specific , the coca  cola corporation built a bottling plant in a small and remote indian village in the state of kerala.spoken english rushihow are chants of death and suicide ... morality.

can ever  never forget the training undergone here which made my life step onto the successful job without any hurdles.

in exchange for sucking vast amounts of water out of the local land, the mighty corporation promised to bring the people great wealth.the staff, material provided, infra structure, environment  low fees totally above the satisfactory markwhat about manson s tees bearing the message,  kill your parents .

rubbish

but within a few short months, the village people began to notice their wells were running dry, so they complained to the corporation.took1  hour to deliver to chatham, hair in food, driver did nt know area.and were the columbine killers acting out this  real morality  when they indescriminately murdered their classmates.

noticed a few of these cookie cutter places opening in summit and new providence.

coca  cola calmed the concerns of the people and attempted to win back their favor by giving them vast amounts of free fertilizer, saying it would grow bountiful crops beyond their wildest dreams.stick to hop hing, 20 year  resident.they were death metal brainwashed fans, literally fulfilling the death metal paradigm, er ... morality.

the greater new orleans fair housing action center  gnofhac  filed a housing discrimination complaint against the housing authority of new orleans  hano  last week.good outside, bad insidei think the jury s still out on exactly who did the brainwashing when in regard to the columbine killers.

the apartment only looks good outsize, inside is too bad.

the complaint, filed with the united states department of housing and urban development, accuses hano of violating a 2003 enforcement agreement entered into between former st. thomas housing development residents, the city of new orleans, hano, and the u.s. department of housing and urban development during the hope vi redevelopment of st. thomas, now known as river garden.too many bugs some you even never seen before.perhaps we should look at the death metal phenomenon less as an invitation to violence than as a coutercultural response to the over hypocrisy of a large percentage of the  church  morality  crowd, which gives a lot of lip service to loving thy neighbor, but does nt apply that love very far beyond their own congregation.

the attitude of some staff is terrible, did not solve anything only say i can do nothing.

the current complaints allege that hano has not provided qualified former st. thomas residents a preference with respect to available public housing units at river garden per the 2003 agreement.great tmobile servicethe last i checked, the satanists have a long way to go to catch up with the death and destruction dealt out by self  proclaimed  though false  christians.

i was with verizon and i checked my service with tmobile and it was great so i thought i would try tmobile.

upon return to new orleans after the hurricane katrina evacuation, former residents have been informed that there are no available public housing units at river garden because those units have been reserved for hano employees.it turned out being very good quality tmobile service and i was happy with the new tmobile phone.irony is dead ... long live irony

okay, i do nt have a review, but why in the hell would you name your business something that has the initials kkk .... is there something behind the scenes at this place

new scientist spacelike i m legitimately concerned at this point ... lolto not buying the bs

fresh and excellent quality

nasa is looking to private companies to launch both supplies and astronauts to the international space station, it announced this week.we order take out from here all the time and we are never disappointed.here i am thinking that i really must be getting old.

the food is always fresh and delicious.

...it can be a little on the spicy side but just ask them exactly what you want and they are very helpful.since the article was specifically about  death metal  i guess the author missed this little tidbit or we just have waaaaaaaaaaaaay different definitions of morality

i really want to like this place since i work right around the corner.

it s not cost  effective doing station flights while at the same time focusing on getting back to the moon,  says brett alexander, vicepresident of transformational space, one of the companies hoping to launch astronauts to the iss.unfortunately, i ve given it a couple of tries at different times and decided to stop going.httpnews.bbc.co.uk2hiprogrammesthisworld4446342.stm

the employees do nt really seem to enjoy what they are doing and it shows.

nasa intends upon retiring the space shuttles in 2010, which only leaves it with 18 flights towards the iss.class act.one man s relentless search for his missing son led him to uncover one of the most shocking crimes in postwar italy  a tale of satanism and violence that has gripped the country for more than a year.

it was late in the day and i was worried i would get charged an arm and a leg and have to wait forever.

outsourcing these responsibilities would be a wise alternative, considering the accomplishments of the private sector regarding the space elevator.they picked my car up in yarmouth and towed to bath for a great price.in january 1998 fabio tollis and chiara marino, both just 16, disappeared.

would do business with them again.

although some may praise this as an opportunity for the private sector to finally serve the public good, nasa seems hesitant about turning over the reigns to the corporate world.great servicethey had been drinking at a pub called the midnight  the centre of the heavy metal scene in milan  and they never came home.

we at rl plumbing services are pleased with your professionalism and the extra mile you went to get out computers working correctly, you will be our first call if anything happens again and we will refer you to other people with computer issues.

new scientist spacedo nt judge a book by its coverthe police and many of their friends just thought they had run off together.

from the outside ichiban looks like it will be terrible.

on3 november, nasa administrator michael griffin told the us house science committee that the agency expects to invest about  500 million in the commercial cargo and crew project over five years.this could nt be farther from the truth.but their parents refused to accept this.

the food is amazing, and the prices can not be beat.

that kind of a financial incentive  ...  will be sufficient to allow substantial providers to emerge,  griffin said.the sushi is great, and they have a great selection.michele tollis, fabio s father, began to attend metal concerts and festivals across europe, handing out leaflets and quizzing fabio s friends.

great work

i hope that industry, if put to the test, can do better  than the government , but i do not expect it,  griffin added.the people at gulf coast siding were very easy and clear to work with.fabio and his friends were into the most extreme forms of heavy metal music  death metal and black metal, music obsessed with images of murder and satanism  and the role of this music is central to the story.

they walked me through all the steps involved in the the installation project so that there were no surprises.

but seeing how the private sector has been able to successfully transport civilians to the iss  at about a fifth of the cost , it would come to no surprise if corporate america was able to out perform their bureaucratic friends in government.natashamichele tollis

a real pleasure training with natasha.

always professional and reliable, sessions are good fun and suitably challenging.it emerged that chiara, the girl who disappeared with fabio, had a collection of satanic literature and paraphernalia in her bedroom.

slow service

httpseattlepi.nwsource.comnationalapmideaststory.aspcategory1107slugpalestinians20abbasi used to take my cars there all the time, but management changes hands too frequently, the service has been slow, and they often try to  add on  extra services, which sometimes is not needed.no one can contradict me when i say that heavy metal and satanism are closely linked.

i do nt go there anymore

normally this author is semiobjective  what blogger is  but on the seattlepi.com  see source link  palestinian leader mahmoud abbas has demanded that israel leave all the land that it occupies before the 1967 border  which includes east jerusalem by the way .great servicethey re inseparable,  he says.

these people were so helpful this week and did everything to sort out my windscreen and insurance.

one thing is certain for sure.it was all sorted with no hassle at all and i m really grateful  they were fab.yeah, i think jeff wrote on one of his posts here in the past several months   to hell with death .

the best customer service i ve come across for long time.

if abbas keeps up this  macho talk  he will kill potential peace talks and might as well allow hamas  which has probably done a better job at providing for the palestinians  rule the west bank.absolutely amazing jobi wholly agree, and would expand that statement to include   to hell with death metal .

susanna is the best dress maker  tailor i ve ever come across in my whole life

ap photo  nasser nassershe makes every item fit you perfectly.the freaky thing here is that these bozos are seriously claiming the moral high ground

she is always so busy, too, which is a good indication of her talent.

interim palestinian leader and the front  runner in the upcoming jan.9, 2005 presidential election mahmoud abbas talks during his first official campaign speech in the west bank town of ramallah, saturday dec. 25, 2004.she s the besttalk about a beat  your  head  against  the  wall moment

teeth

cloaking himself in yasser arafat s legacy, abbas pledged to fulfill palestinian dreams of statehood.this dentist want to pull the tooth out always .. always wants to do the cheapest for his benefit .. not unless he knows you.and for  smartwolf  above, think about the inversion principle being employed.

and hopefully you do not know the same people because he tells others about you payment status.

it seems that the palestinian leadership  upcoming  will not be a peace partner with israel.which should be a private issuethey are doing it deliberately.

i hired this company to unlock my car.

he is already demanding claims that israel said no to not only the world, but to arafat himself.the price they gave was good so i said hey this seems great.do you really think gwb, and neocons in general are representative of true followers of jesus of nazareth

after they showed up there was a little trouble to get my car unlocked, it took quite a bit of time but the job was well done.

listing his priorities, abbas told supporters of the ruling fatah party that he was determined to provide security to his people and continue the struggle against israel s partially completed west bank barrier.bulwark regarding service by erici know, ignorant question  then why call them, or any other phonies  christians , even if they themselves claim the appellation.

just wanted you to know that eric came by as scheduled today and sprayed our house for scorpions.

abbas also pledged to resolve the problem of millions of palestinian refugees and their descendants.he seemed to understand how important it was for us to make sure the whole house was sprayed so he took his time.they are merely imposters.

thank you

abbas, a refugee himself from what is today the northern israeli city of safed, called the refugee issue  very important and very dangerous.a terrible experienceeverything they claim is a lie, and this above all.

i remain unhappy.

having personally visited the west bank and israel, i can say that this new political voice is threatening to collapse the peace process.i still have noticeable scarring.so why even credit their claims

i still have surgically induced hair loss.

if abbas does not change his former thinking and continues the path of yasser arafat, then there will not be peace in the holy land and the palestinians will ultimately suffer.my results were just awful.this only serves their purposes.

my postop treatment was terrible.

selahi would nt recommend this place last year, and i certainly would nt recommend them this year.they want to be identified as  christians , and i fully suspect that for some of them, the motivation behind their subterfuge is more than mere political advantage, and has a lot more to do with the black magician s practice of the inversion principle.

excellent medical care

hat tip  captain s quartershighly recommendalmost all of the avant guard art movements of the early 20th century  except for italian futurism  were labeled  degenerate  by the national socialists.

i went to this urgent care center and was blown away with their service.

bbcfinally a convenient place close to home.adolf hitler even held an exhibition of  degenerate art  in 1937, while curating a parallel show of  aryan  art across the street.

wonderful staff and physician.

the palestinian militant organisation hamas has announced an end to rocket attacks on israel from the gaza strip after a weekend of escalating violence.clean and superb.the german expressionist movement was destroyed as a result.

thanks for the great care

up to 40 rockets had been fired at israel, weeks after its military withdrew from the territory.will definitely go back when i need medical care.here s a quick overview of the entartete kunst  degenerate art  exhibit of 1937

excellence in glasgow

in response to the rockets, israel resumed its policy of targeting militant leaders in air strikes.i v just had my bmw z3 rear window replaced by the guys at kelvin trimmers.httpen.wikipedia.orgwikidegenerateart

the team who work there are helpfull, friendly and extremely knowledgeable and will help you as much as they can with thier years of hands on practice.

authorised by ariel sharon to make  unrestricted  strikes, its military launched new missile attacks overnight.highly recomended.ironically  or perhaps not , the notion of the  degenerate  and  degenerate art  was appropriated by the nazis and its origins can be traced back to jewish  intellectual  max nordau and a 1892 book he authored called degeneration..

my favorite place ...

it looks as if hamas has thrown in the towel for this round, unable to take the beating the israeli defense forces have unleashed upon this terrorist group.my daughter and i stayed here again from the 7th to the 14th of december.nordau was also the co founder of the world zionist organization.

yet again it was a great stay from begiinning to end.

mahmoud zahar, hamas s leader declared the cease fire after israel killed its former leader, muhammed sheikh khalil.okay our room was at times noisy but we were in a mega busy city at an extremely busy time of year.when the apparently cognitively functional take actions that seem senseless and incompetent, it is a most certain sign that they have ulterior or hidden motives.

a definite no

hamas has become rather unpopular in gaza, as many see the israeli air strikes as a response towards the rocket attacks upon israeli soil.incompetent servers, kitchen and management.they trust you and me to be befuddled by their actions, while they  do as they wilt.

expect either undercooked or mushy food and lackluster service.

egypt had a role to play as they convinced hamas to end the attacks, although the same can not be said of islamic jihad.the investors put big bucks into the building but are clueless about what makes a good dining or bar experience.a question

even the least discriminating diner would know not to eat at sprecher s.

jerusalem postwonderful atmosphereare the adherent of  crowleyan thelema  and others of similar ilk appropriating or appropriating from the appropriators to redirect  energy

i have been going there since i was a little girl and love the friendly and relaxing atmosphere.

we re not happy with hamas s position at this stage and in light of the israeli escalation against the palestinians,  commented khader habib, a senior islamic jihad official.dr. stiefvater has always been very professional and helpful.does this reappropriation lead to or originate from the same place

i would recommend bayside chiropractic to anyone who is in need of a regular adjustment or is suffering from a chronic condition.

but it seems that hamas has its own political agenda.channel guideseems as if there is a clear distinction being made between the  imaginary  whore of babalon and the actually whore of babylon, which is this global system.

believe it or not, but the channel guide has been most helpful to my family members that visit and do nt know where to start when it comes to watching satellite tv.

...i just give them guide and they can find anything they need.is the distinction accurate and valid

thanks again, directv.

the problem is not with the palestinian resistance groups but with israel s scheme to destroy the palestinians  infrastructure,  habib said.michael helped shoot the majority of my firm s website and we could not have been happier.does the distinction actually exist

we went through six photographers to find the right photographers that would represent our firm in the light we wished to and michael and his team made that happen.

hamas remains targeted by israel, as in the past, and the israeli occupation does not need excuses to pursue its aggression.he s worth every penny.this is where the socio  political aspect of this conundrum comes into play.

average food and deathly slow service

israel wants to drive the palestinians toward civil war.i have eaten here several times and every time the service is slower than slow.confused

one time we even left after sitting at the table for 20 minutes and not being greeted with a drink order.

islamic jihad has refused to recognized the cease fire, and hopes to turn the gaza strip  into a vast battlefield.ridiculous.good.

there must be a better mexican place in rockland.

unless president mahmoud abbas steps in, gaza will probably look like a battle field by the time israel is done reminding hamas of their critical error, although currently the only thing abbas is doing is lashing out and refusing to take responsibility for his inability to act.i am in love with the giant plate of nachosso, enemy, what s your point

last time i went however, my beer was warm and the service was so  so.

i get that careless teenager kind of treatment from some of their staff ... perhaps they should hire more serious adults to help serve  cook.why do nt you state it

randy, this is the issue i left you the voice mail on.
article6 of the gallup compression services agreement  which i am sending to you separately  with ecs obligates ecs to  work in good faith with cdec  to establish an automated system that would automatically have alerted us to peak loading conditions on cdec s system.
we had a pretty good idea when we signed the contract that ecs would not be able to complete that by the contract start date, so we negotiated a fall back plan under which ecs is obligated to  assist  transwestern  in developing a manual system to accomplish the same result and will hold harmless and keep  transwestern  whole for all cost and expenses  associated with the manual system.
we will fight with them about who owes the  200 k that james mentions below based on their failure to  assist  us in managing the cost.
in the mean time, we need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to get a handle on the situation to mitigate future costs.
do we have someone who is watching this out there
we are running so full tilt on tw that we may not have as much flexibiltiy to manage this situation as we expected, but let me know what we can do.
james had heard that one hold up was the absence of a confidentiality agreement  i guess between ecs and transwestern  that would permit ecs to communicate to us the details on how to access teh key info. from cdec.
that sounds like a bs excuse from ecs, but it that s what they are saying, let me know and we can figure out a solution.
thanks.
df
james centilli
12142000 0249 pm
would you please contact gerald nemec and review the gallup compression service contract in respect to the load control management.
my understanding was that ecs was to provide a means to access cdec s online profile in order for us to make a decision to avoid running the compressor during cdec s peak load periods.
we have not received access to this information which has resulted so far in additional electric cost of  200,987.33 for the period of july through september.
additional cost will be incurred for the remainder of this year, that i have not been able to review yet.
this cost is averaging  79,000 per month if we continue to run the compressor as we have in august and september.
good point, but i m comfortable we re covered because our bidders were all bidding on a chunk of capacity and primary points.
they are deemed to be on notice that they had alternate point rights  it s in the tariff  and if they wanted to submit a bid that had a different rate for primaries and alternates, they could have done so.
none of them did, and most importantly, the winning bidders did not.
our letter agreement simply memorializes that we will charge the same negotiated rate whether the gas flows on primaries or alternates.
i assume from your message you are ok with this and they can get it nailed down
df
i just got done looking at the underlying contract language as set forth in the pro forma service agreement in the tariff and it specifically says that the max rate would apply unless a discount or negotiated rate has been agreed to.
my concern with adding the language below is, could it be argued that not everyone knew the rate would or could apply at any point, since we just stated topack and needles and if they knew they might have bid a different rate
susan scott

i believe you got a copy of the john sommer letter to producers dated jan6 that mkm s spies intercepted.
she forwarded the sommer letter to stan and discussed it with him.
dari and i vented our aggravation by drafting the attached letter to gibson and kyle complaining of sommer s duplicity, but after tempers cooled, mkm and i decided not to send it to stan or urge him to send a written response.
as it stands, mkm and i will probably bring it up with sommer in ok city and strongly suggest the importance of coordinated communication to the producers.
stan may also bring the letter up orally next time he s on the phonne with gibson or kyle as an example of how not to handle this situation.

can we have a meeting this week  maybe thursday at 330  to discuss this
jim
we do need a formal plan.
we have been working closely together to identify the issues as they develop and propose solutions.
doug has been providing us with the necessary specific market information.
we have been successful in communicating that information to the new commissioners and ercot and seeking resolution.
the commission is definitely more responsive to market participants that are articulating the issue, providing specific examples and proposing the solution.
grand  standing is ignored.
those who show up with complaints but can not point to specifics are virtually ignored.
those who show up and complain, but are not participating in the working groups and the daily ercot phone calls, board meetings, etc. are ignored.
doug and i met with the chairman of puct and have had subsequent conversations.
thane and i also visited with him.
pat wood made a phone call to tom noel and told him to get the texas market fixed.
even though he has bigger things to do in d.c., this is his legacy and he recognizes that if deregulation does not work in texas, the repercussions could be global.
chairman sibley and chairman wolens  of the texas legislature  are also engaged in market developments.
we have been working with the state affairs legislative committee and keeping them apprised.
there is an electric restructuring committee hearing scheduled for september 6th or 7th.
the forum is expected to be invited testimony only.
those currently listed as invitees are puct commissioners and ercot s sam jones and tom noel.
the hearing is focused on the pilot and we have an opportunity to provide some probing questions for wolens to direct to sam and tom.
now that sibley is not a candidate for lt. governor, there is more freedom to open up and ask some difficult questions.
thane is in austin on friday, but is available by phone.
i will be on a plane to houston at 800 a.m.
can we find another time that works for us to meet
thane is in an ercot prs meeting friday from 930 until 300.
i am available after rick s friday budget meeting ... are you available then
you are right, we do need a formal plan, thane has started an initial draft.
thanks, jean
jean  thane
walking out last night, kevin presto indicated that there were games being played in ercot with the new market rules and prices in certain markets were not reflective of working markets.
enron needs to use this situation to quickly get our viewpoints up into the puct and ercot iso on what is driving these problems and our proposed fixes.
if ercot goes the way of california  either due to market power or poor market design rules  it will be a bad day for deregulation and for pat wood.
as important, the new puct commissioners need some help right now in messaging the market.
let s get them to support constructive solutions that will make a real difference.
jean and thane, i think that we need a formal plan on what to do over the next3 6 months to leverage this situation.
i would like to discuss this with you on friday am.
i am free at8 am on friday before rick s budget meeting.

as an outgrowth of the meeting leslie and i had with scott and hunter a couple of weeks ago, we have begun work to develop an electronic tool that would allow us to provide ongoing summaries of ferc gas activities, and possibly electric activities, in a format that can be linked to the fundamentals intranet site used by the traders.
we envision a format that would provide a brief summary and analysis of the order, filing, etc. with a link to the source document as well for those who would like more detailed information.
this would replace the paper copies you and your people are currently getting.
many details remain to be worked out, but we will keep you advised.

when the company is set up in the eol database we link the company to the parent and reference the cp id.

re  cargill ferrous international
it was my understanding with the eol team that all divisions would have the legal incorporated entity as part of the name.

we informed tana that we made the change in global counterparty to include,  a division of cargill incorporated .
we will meet in the near future to discuss the issues surrounding division and trade name setups in global counterparty.
bill
bill
if sam s description below of the gcp procedure is correct, it looks to me like something needs to be changed.
the difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty s name from global counterparty.
since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names.
if the correct legal name is not in global counterparty, the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself.
that is the source of tana s concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system.
my suggestion is that global counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the enrononline password application  my understanding is that the enrononline team returns inappropriate applications to the customer until they are correctly completed.
in this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on enrononline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining.
i would appreciate it if you could get this one fixed today and, if you have any problem with changing the gcp procedure, please let me know.

fyi ...
cargill ferrous international is set up correctly in the global counterparty system as a division of cargill, inc.
cargill ferrous international is the full name of this division and set up as such in gcp with a sub  to  legal link to cargill, inc. per gcp procedure.
also, the global sap team  cheryl johnson  would need legal name change documentation from the counterparty in order to change this name.

any updates on adding the correct legal name to this counterparty name
hello,
yes, gcp provides the links to establish the correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems.
gcp procedure is to create counterparty names that reflect either the tradename  division name or parent name  not both simultaneously.
although, we have broken that rule for legal in the past.
this defeats the purpose of using a tradename.

to whom it may concern
through tv and newspapers, i hear constantly about identity fraud using stolen social security information.
i am very concerned about this issue.
i have the following suggestion for our company.
since enron s employees are assigned an sap identification numbers  p number  and an hr number, could enron as a company use these ids instead of the ss numbers
this will be safer for all employees.
for example, i am concerned when i buy the monthly bus passes and i have to fill in my ss number.
i do not feel secure at all to see my ss in so many databases at enron, especially when some databases are from third  parties  out  sourcing .
we could use our badge number there instead of our ss.
please let me know how your organization can help the enron employees feel safer about the safeguard of their ss number.
please calendar and print for my files on this meeting.

fyi re  nepco picketing issues.
michelle
michelle,
two in one day.
we understand that the pipe fitters are also planning to picket the lake worth, florida project as well.
our execution team needs to get some guidance and planning for this picketing should it interfere with the progress of the work.
in that respect, we need to dial in rick johnson and olgletree to plan and communicate that plan to the execution team.
i think the first step is a call between yourself, me, mark stubley and mike indivero.
and then another call with all folks or a meeting at the jobsite to lay out the plan.
barbara, please organize a call for mike, michelle, mark stubley and me.
thanks.
david,
i have been advised by our construction manager, mr. joe osler that while he was visiting the city of lake worth building planning and zoning dept regarding our permit status he learned that the pipefitters have inquired about permit requirements to picket our site.
apparently the city informed them that no permit is required.
i have heard that the pipefitters have established a picket line at the payne creek site today.
we will need local legal counsel to assist us in this regard.
mike indivero, i understand that mr. mike croall s release date from nepco is oct 31, 2001.
please advise as to who his replacement is and their report date.

hope you ll have time to review it today.
ss has again asked about the gtee and lc wording.
they do not have anything from us in writing confirming the agreed changes.
joe asked that you fax the revised gtee wording that has been agreed  i believe it was our agreeing to reduce the claim period from 15 days down to5  and the new lc wording  drops the2 day period to replace an lc with a different bank if the first refuses to pay .
i know we talked about these issues earlier, but tiger s lawyers want to get everything agreed in writing now so final docs can be issued for signing, even if we are the ones issuing the gtee and lc.

confidential settlement document per cpuc rule 51
gas accord ii settlement participants
attached is pge s gas accord ii  ga ii  settlement proposal.
we believe it addresses many of the issues and concerns you have raised in the workshops.
as an overview, this proposal   maintains the basic gas accord structure in place today for the period 2003 to 2007.
offers end user transportation rates for 2003 lower for most customers than rates in effect today.
provides for vintaged redwood path rates for core customers.
offers a 7.5 cent  dth rate to large customers while minimizing rate changes to other customers, minimizing the incentive for these customers to seek to bypass local transmission charges and other cpuc  approved charges.
adopts guidelines to improve reliability and help moderate prices in gas commodity markets, and identifies the capital projects needed to meet these guidelines over the course of the ga ii period  2003  2007 .
provides a high degree of rate stability, with a 3.5  escalator to capture both inflation and the cost of needed capital projects.
the guaranteed rates will be adjustable only for significant changes in the cost of capital or increased costs due to governmental requirements or catastrophic events.
preserves a rate differential between the redwood and baja paths, although somewhat less than the current differential.
proposes a two  stage open season for firm transportation services beginning in 2003, with end users receiving a first option on available capacity.
maintains the core aggregation program with some adjustments.
pge also anticipates that the core procurement incentive mechanism  cpim  will be similar to today s mechanism, but will reflect the somewhat larger capacity holdings needed to meet anticipated increases in core demand and to meet a1  day in 10  year cold weather event.
this also will serve as a reminder that an all  party meeting is scheduled at pge s headquarters in san francisco on january 10 and 11, to discuss this proposal and to respond to your questions.
we look forward to answering your questions and receiving your feedback.
the attached documents include the ga ii settlement proposal, an attachment  a copy of pge s proposed gas rule 27 , and a set of supporting workpapers.
finally, please note that the settlement document and the attachment are in  word 2000  format.
we would be glad to provide the same documents in an earlier version of word, upon request by individual parties.
we look forward to seeing you on january 10  11.
in the meantime, we extend our best wishes for a safe and happy holiday season.

instead of suggesting a specific rate increase  10 or 15 , i think we should acknowledge that a  modest  increase may be necessary and may in fact be desirable  but that the specific amount of increase should be reasoned and subject to well thought out evidence and hearings, not just determined by whim.
in general, we should not be overly prescriptive at this point and i know you agree with that.
otherwise, i think you have captured the points excellently.
we re in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few months.
but while the  otherwise perishable  thoughts are still fresh in my mind from the hearings on monday and tuesday, i wanted to throw out some observations for discussion in the days  weeks ahead.
observation  the pressure to finger somebody for  price gouging  is increasing.
the administration is hell bent on finding a  fall guy.
the price spikes pose real political risks for davis and he and his folks need and want an easy way out.
his press release following the hearing renewed the call for  refunds.
on my panel, loretta lynch asked reliant and duke to supply her with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to marketers.
and carl wood s remarks were extreme.
at the barton hearing, a liberal democrat  filner  and a conservative republican  hunter  locked arms in calling for refunds.
bilbray joined the  gouging  band wagon.
the utilities repeatedly called on ferc to do a  real  investigation, with hearings, testimony, data discovery  the works.
on the positive side, the ferc commissioners lauded wolak, his analysis, and his remarks on the panel.
wolak said somewhat emphatically that the nature of california s market structure makes it impossible to single out a single participant as the culprit.
he also stated that just everyone s just acting in their own self  interest, responding to the screwed incentives embedded in the structure.
implication  it seems prudent for enron to understand better its risks of getting fingered.
in the best case, the clamoring for a  refund  subsides.
in which case, the only cost to enron is the internal cost incurred to understand better the risks of getting fingered.
in the medium case, investigations find that enron  like others   played by the rules,  but the rules stunk, and enron profited at the expense of california consumers.
you re right, sue.
rates ca nt go up wout declaring the rate freeze over in some fashion  trying to finesse it.
thanks very much for the comments.
harry also had a good comment  do nt specify the amount of rate increase in our comments  rather note that the rate increase needs to be well  reasoned and based on facts and evidence.
will make that change.

tom byargeon, kevin miller and ken loch in ena are working with producers in the us involved in deep water offshore louisiana  texas oil and gas drilling projects.
this financing activity was primarily started to help ena secure long term well head and pipeline natural gas supplies to supplement the gas trading desk activities.
just like what happened in enron s initial vpp program they are find more interest in oil drilling projects rather than natural gas projects.
they are currently working on a bid  due 131  for the medusa project which involves murphy  operator , agip and callon in mississippi canyon blocks  538 and  582.
the initial reservoir reports estimate reserves of 80  120 million barrels of sour crude and they estimate initial production to be 40,000 bpd starting in 1q 2003.
quality is estimated to be a mars type crude with 25  27 api gravity and 1.5  2.0  sulfur.
plans are to build a private pipeline to equilon s west delta  143 platform and then bring the oil onshore.
peggy is finding out where wd  143 pumps to onshore.
tom s group would like to know if we have any interesting in buying the crude on either a fixed or floating basis.
the floating could be tied to a platt s index or the nymex.
it is far too early to expect murphy to enter into a physical or financial contract, but tom hopes to get us first and  or last look from murphy when the time is right.
another alternative is to give murphy barrels at their 95,000 bpd meraux, louisiana refinery in exchange for the new production barrels.
could someone in your group please give me a notional non binding basis differential for this quality of crude for cal 2003

following up on our discussion yesterday  for these types of deals, i do nt think it s necessary to have all the documentation of our counterparty s authorization to enter into the agreement.
these are short term transactions and requiring this documentation will cause us to lose business because competitive alternatives do not have such burdensome requirements.
the primary reason we need these things is for the scenario where a muni does a derivative deal with an open  ended downside, loses  50 million, and then claims that it was not a valid contract.
in our case, they are only hedging.
we are collecting a premium up front and their total cost is known up front.
therefore they will not attempt to make this claim.
even if they did, our risk is limited to the premium, not some big payout.
the risk of losing business is far greater than the risk of a counterparty trying to get their premium back.
seems like a5 second decision to me.
is it possible to combine the standard isda and our confirm into a single long form
by going away from the standard isda maybe we can eliminate these requirements because the payout liability is only1  way.

what happened
here s a story ... as i was waiting at the bus stop  735 am  to go to school, a lady approached me and asked if i d make sure her daughter got on a certain bus.
the mother was running late for work and could not wait.
i could nt say no ... so nicki  the little girl  10 yrs. old  and i waited for the bus.
it was now, 815 and there was no sign of her bus.
on top of things, i had quiz at8 am.
which i then realized i missed.
i decided that nicki would just have to wait on her own.
i asked her if she had any relatives that would want to know of her whereabouts.
i called her grandmother and explained things to her.
pretty strange ... aye.
a bus that runs through uofh arrived and i almost got on without her, but i could nt do it.
finally, i told the little girl that she would have to accompany me to school  830 am .
there were only 15 minutes left of class.
i stayed for the remainder of the lecture.
after class we went back to bus stop and within minutes her bus arrived.
i told the bus driver where to drop her off.
i notified her grandmother with the time of the departure.
and i was relieved when nicki called to let me know she was home safe.
please send the memo to the egm business heads as well.
thanks.

all,
the analyst and associate programs recognize we have many analyst needs that need to be addressed immediately.
while we anticipate many new analysts joining enron this summer  late may  and fulltime  august  we felt it necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an off  cycle recruiting event.
we are planning this event for thursday, february 15 and are inviting approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.
i am asking that you forward this note to any potential interviewers  managers or above .
we will conduct first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the afternoon.
we need for interviewers to commit either to the morning 9 am  12 pm  or afternoon 2 pm 5 pm  complete session.
please submit your response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.
in addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking one or more of these analysts should they be extended an offer.
thanks in advance for your cooperation.
thank you,

marianne  the following are my comments
1. in section 1.1, there should be a parentheses after etc. in the 5th line.
2. in section 3.1, in the last sentence after the proviso insert  a  before the word  change  and after the word  in .
3. in section 6.1, change 20 business days to 20 days.
also, add a semicolon at the end of clause  i .
4. in section 6.2.1 i ll just note that the discount rate sentence i think is still an open issue.
5. in section 6.3, clause  c  should be reworded to fit with the language in the beginning of the section.
6. capitalize the word  facility  in the definition of average annual load factor.
7. delete the definition of costs as it is already defined in section 6.2.1.
8. where is the defined term govt authority used
9. in the gtc, the ecp rep should also apply to eesi.
also, in the 7th line of the reps add the word  into  after the word  entered  and before the word  this .
10. in collateral requests, insert a comma after deposit in the last line.
i will also add granting  perfection language.
11. in events of default, clause  a  refers to a dispute section which i m not sure exists.
in clause  e , delete the  s   from the word consolidation.
12. remedies should be deleted as it is already covered in section 6.1.
13. in ucc  disclaimer of warranties, add a clause  c .
i would add setoff language.

i have attempted to incorporate the changes that jim has incorporated in our long form power agreement which ena has suggested to date into the short form.
attached please find a sample short form  for the con ed market  for your review.
please note the following as you review
1. the short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services  all of our midmarket forms anticipate that we will act as customer s billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related to td and the like from the customer  and reflect same on our invoice  and pass those amounts on to the customer s utility.
2. i did not include a  setoff  provision in this draft, mainly because the vast majority of the time, we will not, nor will an affiliate, have another agreement in place with these customers.
if you feel strongly about our including a setoff provision, we will do so.
3. the change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form  the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh  and we ve had great difficulty selling it in the past .
taking into consideration this class of customer, we decided to include certain items, including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law, rules or practices as a  force majeure event  in an effort to soften the approach  see the gtcs .
also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in the event of a change in law as the long form does  again, more in the interest of  saving space  than anything else ...
let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched.
if you are comfortable, we will drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms.
thanks again for your help with this project,
marianne
p.s. please be sure to copy sarah dietrich and jennifer hillegonds on your response  they will be taking this project during my  hiatus   i am moving to pa on friday of this week, and will be out of pocket through approximately 716.

i think valerie mooney  our credit person  and ed sacks are still discussing some minor fine tuning of the loc format.
i spoke to bob bruce this morning  we re all set on the language in the schedule to the isda, and there is a minor credit  billing issue in paragraph 13 related to the timing of transfer of interest on collateral that val will discuss with ed as well.
as far as the eei goes, the only remaining issue that i m aware of  aside from finalizing the loc  is whether we ve finished coordinating the attachment containing the list of prior transactions.
sounds like we may actually get these documents executed early next week.

all,
please see the attached interconnect agreement with questar.
i wanted you all to have a look at what we believe is the final draft.
it is a fairly standard, fully reimbursable interconnect with questar.
transwestern will own and operate the interconnect.
you will notice that questar has requested a  payment plan  that details when they will pay transwestern for the interconnect due to the recent enron events.
if anyone has any questions or concerns about the timing of these payments, please give me a call.
also, you will notice this interconnect may not be subject to the ciac tax gross up, but to protect ourselves, we have added language in para 3.2 that protects us financially if the irs ever comes back to determine that this interconnect is subject to the ciac tax.
robert guthrie with the tax department has worked with us to develop this language.
we hope to execute this agreement this week.
if you have any comments, please let me know.
after execution, we will forward a final copy to you for your files.
thanks,

we are looking at putting the metering facilities on their row  also, i think we will have to purchase about 50 ft of row from elpaso to get to questar s property .
as you look at this, if for some reason we can not obtain elpaso row, we will have to look at plan b which would be to put the metering on our row.
our in  service date is may1.
if you think that may1 may be difficult due to receiving the parts  materials on a timely basis because of the issues that vendors may have with us because of recent enron events, please let me know.
questar has already informed us that they would help obtain parts  materials to our specifications if it helps achieve an in  service date of may1.

note
total transportation invoiced for 2001 was  180.9 m.
the amount of transportation revenues recorded in the general ledger is  165.9 m.
this difference is mainly due to the following
10.0 m  negotiated rates reserve  reliant, sempra, richardson, astr, and bp energy    collected
2.7 m  socal rate issue   not collected
1.8 m  additional month of pge revenues due to prepayment invoicing beginning in 2001   collected
revenues for these customers were adjusted according.
also, revenues for the shippers acquiring released volumes from pge at rates above tw s tariff rates were adjusted accordingly.

the in  service date of may1, will be very difficult to attain.
since the bankruptcy filing, vendors have been very reluctant to ship material prior to it being prepaid  daniels, fisher, rosemont, other .
these are the vendors of instrumentation required for the interconnect.
questar may be able to purchase material, but some of the items can have up to a 60 day delivery.
from time pa approved and funded to in  service will be 75 days at most.
we have worked with daniels on a chromatograph on another project and prepayment has taken 45 days alone.
daniels is not set up for prepayments as they bill off an invoice and the main office and accounting had to create an invoice for a chromatograph that had not been delivered.
not the usual mode of operations.
the ic design is for a ultrasonic meter and this is dependent on their testing schedule  canada or kansas are the only two places to test to 100  of design .
will confirm testing schedule and delivery dates with ultrasonic asap.
we will try to complete the ic with the earliest in  service date possible, but with conditions as they are, a realistic date would be june 15, 2002.
if you have questions or issues, please let me know.
thanks

our in  service date is may1.
if you think that may1 may be difficult due to receiving the parts  materials on a timely basis because of the issues that vendors may have with us because of recent enron events, please let me know.
questar has already informed us that they would help obtain parts  materials to our specifications if it helps achieve an in  service date of may1.
thanks,
kim.
listening to the edison call w investors edison says they will pay everyone at the same time   big bang  approach  sometime in q1 02.
my concern is that between now and then dunn, the ag have the time and resources to make a heckuvalot of mischief, which could be detrimental to generators  marketers  claims.
investors are asking what edison intends for qfs and generators  asking about haircuts in particular  and edison is side  stepping the questions.
great.
figured they d contacted them, but wanted to make sure.

probing the  palace coup
electricity  a panel focuses on price hikes and the actions of the iso president.
september 26, 2001
by kimberly kindy
the orange county register
sacramento
a state senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage california s energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices.
the investigative committee, headed by state sen. joe dunn, d  santa ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the capitol   the palace coup.
lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events  directed by the man who heads the state s energy grid  fueled the california energy crisis, pushed the state into the power  buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers.
the central question behind the palace coup is whether terry winter, the president of the independent system operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge.
winter defied his own board and gov. gray davis when he filed a 50  page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show.
i do nt know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort,  said dunn.
the subpoenas will force those involved, including winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over emails, personal calendars and memos.
davis spokesman steve maviglio said the governor felt  betrayed  by the actions of winter.
the governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis,  maviglio said.
winter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office.
iso spokesman gregg fishman said dunn s committee will find no criminal conduct.
the decision was made by iso upper management with one goal in mind  to keep the lights on.
at the time, generators were refusing to sell power in california because of the price caps.
it was an emergency,  fishman said.
we had to take action.
what became known as the palace coup began on oct. 26 when iso board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power.
the restrictions would drive prices as low as  65 per megawatt  nearly 12 times below the  750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier.
they  electricity generators  grinned and beared the  750 price cap, but this new plan by iso was too much,  said dunn, whose committee has been investigating since march.
all hell broke loose.
records show that on oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the federal energy regulatory commission, demanding that the new plan be killed.
the letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators.
if not removed immediately, the  iso  price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,  read one letter written by duke energy vice president william hall iii.
although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials.
he said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to  fix  prices, which would violate federal trade laws.
in the oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps were nt removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market.
the generators got their way.
the next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan.
what was left in place was a  250 price cap established five months earlier.
power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they could nt make a profit even under these constraints.
they began to withhold power from california, and on dec.7 the iso declared its first stage3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted.
what followed the next day is considered by the governor and dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis.
winter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the iso, submitted a 50  page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the  250 price cap.
final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government.
neither the iso board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of winter s actions until the cap had been removed.
in fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, charles robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and iso board members just hours before the filing was made.
he did nt mention anything about it.
in retrospect, we should have told them,  robinson said.
with the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs.
the iso staff sat in a meeting with the governor s key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,  maviglio said.
it was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant.
this action accelerated the utilities  move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power  buying business.
prices for electricity jumped from an average of  249 a megawatt to  700 a megawatt within three days, iso records show.
dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded  30 billion.
robinson said the filing  granted two hours after the request  helped rather than hurt californians.
prices, he said, did not spike as a result.
instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas  which is used to run power plants to generate electricity.
robinson said the emergency order allowed the iso to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials.
we believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,  robinson said.
in our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation.
we felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund.
jan smutney  jones, who was the iso board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap.
smutney  jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power  generating community being consulted.
terry did this by himself,  said smutney  jones, executive director of the independent energy producers.
he did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing.
the iso board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding winter explain his actions.
some board members pushed to have winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor s spokesman maviglio said.
james j. hoecker, the former federal energy regulatory commission chairman, defended making the december decision and also defended winter.
they filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let california go dark,  hoecker said.
they  iso management  did what any independent system operator would do.
what dunn s committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired.
he believes memos and emails around the time of winter s dec.8 actions should provide vital clues.
we do nt know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out,  dunn said.
terry said he made that filing in the interest of californians, but i find that argument has no basis in fact.
we should resurrect mike smith s note and get him on the call in the attempt to avoid recreating the wheel on this one.
i can dig it up if you d like.

i am having a meeting with vicki and janet dietrich on thursday to discuss our view on the ability to extend our current contracts in ca  for customers already on da .
can we discuss this today or soon thereafter.
my take is that the udcs will be indifferent to this  maybe   and our 1 priority is to work to get the pge model adopted across the state.
any news on how sce and sdge will move forward
thanks.
sounds good.
i suggest a  blind draw  on the teams, best ball not scramble on the golf, and as for the wager, no emails from the losing team for one week
is there any question
i ll leave to steve to structure the deal.
as i recall, montavano, shapiro and i usually make up one team, but i m willing to switch around a bit.

it s a two way street, of course.
have they expressed any interest in negotiating
there is nothing wrong with a real negotiation, but nothing particularly helpful about generating one that s just for show.
particularly in the absence of any entreaty from them.
where is the  simple  explanation of the transportation piece
as i have told rnr, i think we should advise duke in writing that its ip is not in conformity with the contract, since it is in the alternative, and that our ip is hence the only one that will be before the arbitrators  since duke clearly can not change its ineffective ip at this stage, having already seen ours .
accordingly, the only issue left for arbitration is whether our ip  the only one and therefore the one they have to choose  is or is not an economic hardship under the contract.

dear mr. sanders

while i left a you a phone message with some information about our project, i thought i could give you some additional details by email as well ...

we are still very interested in having enron support our ecommerce dispute management protocol.
we have had enthusiastic responses from companies such as att, duke energy, pitney bowes and daimler chrysler, and i would be pleased to answer any questions you may have about this focal point for our educational efforts.
the real purpose of my call, however, is related to the services we will provide to support the aspirational statements of the protocol.
i am a member of the design group that has been developing the american arbitration association s dispute management systems and services for ecommerce b2b transactions.
at this time we are putting together small working groups to validate some of our assumptions and refine our initial service offerings.
initially our design group, along with perhaps one of our technology consultants, would like to meet with a group of enron people for half a day.
ideally this group would consist of four to six people from finance, legal, and operations so that we get good crossfunctional feedback about our services.
before the meeting we would provide you with a brief description of our proposed service offerings and a list of points for discussion at the meeting.
the real focus of the meeting will be on how we should build these services to meet the needs of businesses operating in b2b marketplaces.
we are very concerned with providing services that are relevant to that environment.
we would like to meet between november 14 and  december1  since construction of our services is already underway.
please let me know what is possible, and feel free to give me a call if you have any questions  9783769004 .

the industry of marriage and kids, you heard me.
marriage is, in and of itself, a noble concept, but it too often leads to kids and kids flat out suck.
how can i say such an abomination, ask you
look around you and notice all the mind numbing trailor trash cretins out there who should not be procreating, yet they do.
these are the people who keep jerry springer on the air.
these are the kids who will destroy society, because of the crapfest the american family has become under the post hippie culture, you heard again.
and you might think by reading this i blame the kids .....
not so, kids are what kids are and will do what they do.
it is literally monkey see and monkey do with them.
that will likely never change.
it s the bad parents out there who fuck up their lives and do nt seem to understand that once you decide to have kids, it is indeed time to grow up and be a responsible role model for those kids.
very few parents do this.
and this is a direct result of the politically correct, permissive, time out granting bullshit liberal culture that has caused this.
when you blame it all on society, there s noone to to take responsibility and all of a sudden you have generation of fucked up kids who are likley smoking, drinking, doing drugs, fucking the neighbor or some internet perv just because you are too lazy to see waht they re doing.
people like this will never have my sympathy, nor do they deserve my sympathy.
look inside yourselves parents, is this you
probably it is.
fuck you.
stop trying to pawn your brats off on others to  get a break .
you made a choice to be a mommy, you do nt get a break until they move out, that s the choice that you madea and that s life.
tough shit.
just because you re stuck, does nt give you the right to drag down all the singles around you.
another time i ll segueway into all the fun work related instances where  mommies  get out of doing work and hiding behind childcare as the reason.
this is the insidious conspiracy i call  mommism .
it must be stamped out.

it looks like nasa is ready to sour again after its devastating loss from the columbia accident which occurred nearly two years ago.
now, nasa engineers and astronauts are almost giddy with  go  fever as the tentative date for the first launch since the columbia disaster approaches.
the most important question is nt whether discovery is technically ready to fly with new safety features and emergency procedures, but whether the agency itself has learned from the crucial errors most common to challenger and columbia, errors that grew out of a management culture that discouraged criticism and sacrificed safety for image  puffing and budget  cutting.
i hope so.
seeing another  columbia  incident can be quite frightening  i woke up to it early in the morning when i was in texas .
we do nt need another incident as exploring the cosmos is something that keeps our imagination going as a species.
maybe one day they will allow space tourism,  hopefully that will be in the near future  although i would recommend that nasa build new shuttles instead of trying to preserve the older ones.
you do have to give nasa credit on some things as they have eliminated the  fear of reporting failure  culture that probably led to the lack of reporting defects on the columbia shuttle.
instead they are encouraging everyone to come forward if they see any potential problems  as it is clear that overlooked problems could result in unnecessary losses .
but supporters are pointing a few good things out
clearly, the agency has worked hard at tackling the technical challenges posed by a superb and surprisingly independent  minded investigative panel.
a few weeks ago, shuttle workers at the kennedy space center received a rocket  like boost in morale with two important deliveries for the next shuttle to carry.
one is a special tool to detect damage to the thermal  protective tile while in orbit  something the columbia crew would have welcomed.
the other is a new fuel tank  guaranteed  by nasa not to shed potentially fatal hunks of insulation.
nasa has some pr hurdles to overcome in the future.
but let s hope for their sake  and the sake of all space lovers out there  that they can redefine their image and rekindle the hope of space colonization again.

healing the collective body
in george orwell s influential novel  1984  doublethink is a device promoted by the totalitarian state government to make people accept two irreconcilable ideas at the same time such as  war is peace .
i see the merit in flowing with duality.
one of my most cherished dualities is the understanding that we are both autonomous individuals with the power to shape our personal destinies and at the same time we are all one, that there is no separation between you and i, we are all together in this thing called life, we human beings, the birds and the tress, the rocks and the sky, all of it.
i have written a lot recently about healing the self so today here are a few words on healing our collective body, mind and soul.
think of all life, if you will, as one great choir or one grand congregation.
our strength is in our unity and harmony.
any major dischord and we all suffer.
any insult to the collective good brings us all down.
living out of synch with nature is the great disease, from that flows all the tributaries we have come to think of as sickness.
we are only as strong as our weakest, we are only as healthy as the sickest amongst us  playing sports and being in the army taught me that lesson before i was finished being a teenager.
when the healthy treat the sick with scorn and intolerance it brings us all down.
when those lucky enough not to have herpes create a climate of shame and indignity for those of us who do, not only are they hurting us, but they are hurting themselves.
there is no escape from the collective ocean we all swim in.
what you project will always come back to either reward or haunt you.
we are now suffering from the consequences of our rape of the environment, our rejection of the natural for the industrial, and our embrace of violence over peace.
jesus said that what you do the least of the people you do to him.
what are you doing to the least of the people
if we are all in this thing together, let s play nice.
remember that what you do to yourself affects me and everybody else, remember that what you do to me and anyone else shapes your destiny.
no matter what progress we make as individuals in becoming healthier, we will never achieve real health until we collectively decide to create a healthier reality.
fortunately circumstances will force our hand soon since our collective bad behaviour can not continue indefinitely.
in the near future collective choices will need to be made.
will we choose to live in harmony with this planet or crash and burn in a conflagration of arrogance and disregard
will we choose to rise about prejudice and intolerance or go down kicking and screaming with holding on to fear and anger
there is no health without peace and no peace without health.

quebecker wins u.s. bravery award
pittsburgh
a quebec man was awarded a carnegie medal for bravery on monday for saving two friends by fighting off a polar bear with a pocket knife two years ago on baffin island
dr. eric fortier, 34, of gatineau, que., used a pocket knife to attack a polar bear on baffin island, just south of the arctic circle, to save two friends who were being mauled.
all of the research and all of the preparation i did leading up to the trip gave no indication that there were bears in the soper  river  valley where we were canoeing,  dr. fortier said.
dr. fortier, an orthodontist, learned there was at least one polar bear in the central region of baffin island in july 2001 when he felt what he thought was a dog leaning on his tent wall.
my first thought was to push it away,  he said.
a few seconds later my girlfriend saw the shadow of a bear s paw through the tent fly and then it started ripping through the ceiling.
the polar bear is more dangerous than most other bears.
the latter usually consider human beings a threat but the polar bear considers humans a snack, experts said.
the two screamed to frighten the bear and warn their friends in a tent several metres away but the bear ripped into that tent and began mauling 31  year  old alain parenteau.
their screams changed,  dr. fortier said.
i grabbed my glasses and my knife and unzipped my tent and headed out.
the bear dwarfed the6  foot 1 mr. parenteau, knocking him to the ground, he said.
dr. fortier threw a large rock at the bear, distracting it and allowing parenteau to escape but it then turned on 25  year  old patricia doyon, who was in the same tent.
again dr. fortier threw rocks at the bear and again its target was able to escape.
the bear gave chase and i gave chase,  he said.
at some point, patricia tripped or the bear tripped her and was at her back.
i was beside the bear s head and i stabbed it with an upper cut below the jaw in the neck a couple of times.
the bear ran off.
while there was some fur and blood on the nine  centimetre blade, dr. fortier said he does nt think he hurt the bear badly.
both mr. parenteau and ms. doyon, however, were bleeding badly.
dr. fortier and his girlfriend lashed two canoes together and paddled eight kilometres along the soper river.
dr. fortier travelled another three kilometres by foot to seek help in the nearest settlement.
both mr. parenteau and ms. doyon were airlifted to a hospital and survived, though mr. parenteau had a gash within a centimetre of his jugular, dr. fortier said.
dr. fortier was one of 15 people to receive the carnegie medal on monday.
the bronze medal is given to people who  risk their lives to an extraordinary degree while saving or attempting to save the lives of others.
the other canadian recipient of the medal was ronald joseph crawford, 42, of hamilton, who was killed aug.4, 2002, while trying to defend a hamilton sandwich shop owner from a robber wielding a knife.
mr. crawford threw several punches at the assailant before he was stabbed in the heart.
u.s. industrialist andrew carnegie started a hero fund in 1904 after being inspired by rescue stories from a mine disaster that killed 181 people.
the award comes with a  3,500  u.s.  grant.

hi all,
there are already several forums around the net focused on discussing guild wars, so why create a new one
i say why not
the main reason is google is more accessible to the global community and you can rest assured that it s not going to go away.
i have seen great fan sites suddenly disappear without notice and for no reason.
usually this happens because the developer of the site can no longer afford the cost of bandwidth being used.
that said, the maintenance of this forum is handled by google and thus will remain reliable and it will ultimately give us more time to play .
i m nothing more than a devoted fan of the game myself and i hope that this area can become a haven for deep fan discussions.
regards,
humanpixel

good day mate
i m really looking forward to guild wars.
anyone know a release date
feb 2005
feb 2005 is the projected release date, although guild wars is made by exmembers of blizzard, so feb 2005 could mean august 2006 ...
anyway, i tried to get a preorder but no places were selling it so i missed out on 23 weekend events.
oh well, i ll get it when it comes out in febuary.
rumor has feb 05 on the calender.
but they stated that they will take as long as it takes to work out all the bugs so who really know how long.
as far as pre order go to and they have a list of major retailers that carry it there are also a few websites that you could order it off of.
and a good reason for starting this group .... company firewalls lol
i was kind of curious, what exactly is guild wars
i hav nt heard of it.
check out the guild wars web site at for more info about the game.
it s a massive multiplayer role playing game.
the graphics are without a doubt the amoung the best graphics i have ever seen for any game and i have been gaming since the mud days.
it s worth a look.
i have a preorder and am even considering getting a second preorder to have multiple accounts.
i have participated in all the weekend beta events and the world preview.
the game is already 100  functional.
i ca nt imagine them not being able to meet the feb 05 deadline.
warm greetings to all in this gw community.
i am lady kingel and i hail from the united legit gaming guilds of guild wars.
we are a consortium of legit honorable guilds that was established in 1997 for di and we are now adding gw to the list of games played.
the alliance is a pretty straightforward one.
it was formed to allow many different guilds who were all strictly honorable to come together as a family and allow them many people to game with.
there are no other requirements other than we ask that members greet each new member and each new alliance and also feel free to post in any of the forums.
we are also a group who is looking for members for our own select guild called ulgg of gw ... which is a part of the alliance with the same name.
we play in all aspects of the game and we hand pick our members.
i would like to personally invite each of you to visit our website.
you are individuals of quality, and in our alliance we seek quality of member over quantity of member.
you will be asked to register, and then you should wander over to the announce your arrival section and present yourself.
you will be greeted by many members of this wonderful family.
i do hope to see you visiting us at the fire and we shall prepare a feast for you, as well.
if you paste this in your browser, it will take you directly to our gw website.
i extend my hand to each of you in true friendship, and honor.
come and say hello ... you will be warmly welcomed
we are currently moving to a new server, so we will be down for a while.
i will inform when we are up and running again.
i wish all happy holidays, and moreso, peace on earth.
kingel
dear judges, lawyers, policemen, guards, counselors, taxpayers, et. al.,
we are here.
like it or not, for good or bad, we are here.
who are we
we are the downtrodden and dispossesed, the self  torturing, the disenfranchised convicts, drug and alcohol addicts, the unemployed and unemployable.
we are the children of poverty, financial and spiritual.
we have and will have children of our own, grandchildren too.
we are excons, uninsured, homeless, of many colors and speaking many tongues.
we are the enemy in what has become a domestic war against ourselves.
and who are you
you who like the tough talk of tough on crime
you who watch as budgets are cut in education and health care while you militarize a police force
bullet  proof vests, automatic weapons, helicopters, tanks, robots ... the testosterone is oozing through the streets, more prisons, longer sentences, tighten the belt, spartan conditions, task forces, gang units, gun courts.
and what is there to show for it
unemployent stays low because half the population oversees those  out of the workforce , the dregs, the rabble, the enemy
please tell me there is a deeper reason.
do you feel safer
more humane
more like a cohesive society with a shared sense of purpose, who can identify us and them
do you live in a gated community or gentrified neighborhood
by the way, have you read the declaration of independence and us constitution  or do you only know the first phrases
it s about time we got together.
please know that i have yet to meet a convict who wants their child to be a thief, an addict, a dealer, a prostitute, or a violent individual.
most of us still have hope for ourselves even when stuck in the darkest dilemmas, ruts and catch  22s.
most of us believe in crafting laws and instilling order.
many of us have burrowed beneath the surface to find a spiritual sense of being, an understanding force at least as powerful as those we succumbed to, and many of use would nt escape if you opened the front door.
did you know that approximately 10 million americans are either incarcerated, on probation, on parole or once were in those categories
each of those 10 million have families, friends, neighbors ... and so closer and closer does the we interface with the you.
do nt you think it s time we talked
are you ready
can you accept that the road we are travelling points toward a grim and painful future
do you have the heart to face monumental failures while bravely struggling beyond where we are now
i know that some of you are, and that some of us are, and this is what gives me hope.
you need our insights just as we need your structure.
it is never over, especially when a real solution, a real treatment for our sickness, is yet to begin.
in solidarity,

highly confidential urgent assistance  from usa
from  george walker bush 202.456.1414  202.456.1111 fax  202.456.2461
dear sir  madam,
i am george walker bush, son of the former president of the united states of america george herbert walker bush, and currently serving as president of the united states of america.
this letter might surprise you because we have not met neither in person nor by correspondence.
i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to an account requiring maximum confidence.
i am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance in acquiring oil funds that are presently trapped in the republic of iraq.
my partners and i solicit your assistance in completing a transaction begun by my father, who has long been actively engaged in the extraction of petroleum in the united states of america, and bravely served his country as director of the united states central intelligence agency.
in the decade of the nineteen  eighties, my father, then vice  president of the united states of america, sought to work with the good offices of the president of the republic of iraq to regain lost oil revenue sources in the neighboring islamic republic of iran.
this unsuccessful venture was soon followed by a falling  out with his iraqi partner, who sought to acquire additional oil revenue sources in the neighboring emirate of kuwait, a wholly  owned u.s.  british subsidiary.
my father resecured the petroleum assets of kuwait in 1991 at a cost of sixty  one billion u.s. dollars   61,000,000,000 .
out of that cost, thirty  six billion dollars   36,000,000,000  were supplied by king hussein, kingdom of saudi arabia and other persian gulf monarchies, and sixteen billion dollars   16,000,000,000  by german and japanese partners.
but my father s former iraqi business partner remained in control of the republic of iraq and its petroleum reserves.
my family is calling for your urgent assistance in funding the removal of the president of the republic of iraq and acquiring the petroleum assets of his country, as compensation for the costs of removing him from power.
unfortunately, our partners from 1991 are not willing to shoulder the burden of this new venture, which in its upcoming phase may cost the sum of 100 billion to 200 billion dollars   100,000,000,000   200,000,000,000 , both in the initial acquisition and in long  term management.
without the funds from our 1991 partners, we would not be able to acquire the oil revenue trapped within iraq.
that is why my family and our colleagues are urgently seeking your gracious assistance.
our distinguished colleagues in this business transaction include the sitting vicepresident of the united states of america, richard cheney, who is an original partner in the iraq venture and former head of the halliburton oil company, and condoleeza rice, whose professional dedication to the venture was demonstrated in the naming of a chevron oil tanker after her.
i would beseech you to transfer a sum equaling ten to twenty  five percent  10  25   of your yearly income to our account to aid in this important venture.
the internal revenue service of the united states of america will function as our trusted intermediary.
i propose that you make this transfer before the fifteenth  15th  of the month of april.
i know that a transaction of this magnitude would make anyone apprehensive and worried.
but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.
a bold step taken shall not be regretted, i assure you.
please do be informed that this business transaction is 100  legal.
if you do not wish to cooperate in this transaction, please contact our intermediary representatives to further discuss the matter.
i pray that you understand our plight.
my family and our colleagues will be forever grateful.
please reply in strict confidence to the contact numbers below.
sincerely with warm regards,
george walker bush switchboard  202.456.1414 comments  202.456.1111 fax  202.456.2461 email  presid...whitehouse.gov
us battles to save storm victims
watch the airlift
emergency teams in the southern us are battling to reach survivors of hurricane katrina, the most destructive storm to hit the country in decades.
hundreds of people are feared dead in mississippi, and the louisiana city of new orleans is badly flooded.
the city mayor said rescuers were unable to retrieve the dead.
they re just pushing them aside,  he said.
amid worsening conditions, officials plan to evacuate a new orleans stadium where up to 20,000 people took shelter.
the superdome stadium is without power, and toilets are overflowing.

it s a very, very desperate situation,  louisiana governor kathleen blanco said.

one resident of new orleans said escaping from the storm was  hell .
we were screaming, hollering, flashing lights.
it was complete chaos,  kioka williams told the associated press news agency.
she had to hack her way through the ceiling of her beauty shop as flood waters rose in the city of half a million people  much of which lies below sea level.
flooding
walls keeping water out of the bowl  shaped city have been breached, and emergency teams are using helicopters to drop 1,350 kg  3,000 lb  sandbags and concrete barriers into the gaps.
before the phones went, i was told  my family in biloxi  had lost their roof, barn,2 oak trees and many pines and they were letting in water

new orleans mayor ray nagin said up to 80  of the city was submerged, in some cases by waters6 m  20 ft  deep.
he warned water levels could still rise.
some sections of the city which are dry now could see nine or 10 feet  some3 m  of water,  he said.
the us army corps of engineers says it could take a month to clear the flood waters, and the government s disaster relief agency has urged evacuees not to try to get back to their homes.
the bbc s alastair leithead in new orleans says there is panic as vital supplies run out.
heavily armed police have been trying to impose a form of martial law to stem outbreaks of looting.
while some looters are stealing nonessential goods, others are simply trying to find food and water.
hundreds dead
the situation appears to be even worse in mississippi.
you re going to be looking at hundreds dead along the coast,  a state official said.

casinos housed in barges have been hurled onto the beach and beyond.
tens of thousands are homeless, and officials say it could be weeks before power is restored.
i can only imagine that this is what hiroshima looked like 60 years ago,  said mississippi governor haley barbour after viewing the destruction from the air.
survivors are being found all the time, including two children who lost their parents.
harrison county in mississippi bore the brunt of hurricane katrina as it slammed into biloxi and gulfport before heading inland.
mississippi media earlier reported 54 people killed in the state.
in biloxi, 30 people were reported dead in one block of flats which was hit by a9 m  30 ft   storm surge .
the town s death toll may be  in the hundreds , municipal spokesman vincent creel said.

louisiana s governor blanco urged residents to spend wednesday in prayer and assured them the crisis would eventually be overcome.

the us red cross has mobilised thousands of volunteers for its biggest  ever natural disaster effort and federal emergency teams are being dispatched to affected areas.
president george w bush, who has cut his holiday two days short, has called on americans to donate to the red cross or other organisations.
damage estimates of more than  25 bn suggest it could be the us insurance industry s most expensive natural disaster ever.
the price of crude oil on the international market hit a record  70.85 a barrel due to the vulnerability of oil and gas fields in the gulf of mexico.

excellent answer googlenut.
let me add some additional info.
you can get details about nasa spending here, from their own webpage.
also, from their own webpage, reasons why nasa is important, in a 5th grade format.
i guess if you are someone not familiar with how nasa benefits our society i can see how one might form the opinion of yheggy  ga.
let me put it this way  if you have watched tv recently, crossed a modern bridge, flown in an airplane, recieved any form of modern medicine, did any mathematics, drove a car, used a cellular phone, etc. then you have somehow directly reaped the rewards which nasa has returned to us.
also nasa has a large outreach program for education, some people believe this is important.
best, steve.
subject  re  nasa is a waste  from  jaqamofino  ga on 26 apr 2005 0602 pdt
i believe that nasa is a huge waste of tax payers  money, but there are so many huge wastes of tax payer monies, that i find it best not to think about it.
i also think the national endowment for the arts is a waste, but i guess i would rather see my money go to the nea than nasa.
of course, in a perfect world, tax payers  money would go toward some sort of national healthcare program, and housing for the homeless, but this is far from a perfect world.
in response to steve s comment  do you really believe that spending trillions on space exploration over the years was the only way to invent the cellfone
and bridges
i find that extremely hard to believe.
i think it could have been done in a much more cost efficient way, right here on bad  old  planet  earth.
just my two cents.
thanks for listening.
please take a moment to read this.
i realize that it may sound strange, but we are desparate in our efforts and are willing to try anything to help our dear sick friend.
this costs absolutely nothing, and will take about one minute of your time.

in quick summary, beyond control, a local band in our area, is sponoring a benefit for a cancer victim whose benefits have run out.
that band is involved in a local competition which promises a  5000 first prize, which they would like to win in order to donate it to the benefit fund which they have started.
below are some emails to friends explaining a little more about this effort.
what we are trying to do is solicit votes for the band, in order to put them in first place.
they are currently in third place, and need your help so that the prize money can be used for a humanatarian cause.

thanks,
fred
john,
i will attach the letter explaining the benefit we are sponsoring.
there is a link to the contest page.
any help in distributing this will be greatly appreciated.
it is certainly for a good cause.
abby needs to fly to new york twice a month for these treatments, and her time on the federal grant program has expired.
she does nt have the funds to continue without the grant, and without these treatments, her prognosis is grim.
i hope you have a huge network.
also encourage your recipients to forward this along to their contacts, and so on, so that the movement to help her grows exponentially.
we must finish in first place in order to contribute the  5000 to the benefit fund.
thank you so much for caring enough to offer your help.

the connection, however, lies in an order issued last year by president hu jintao to seek secure oil supplies abroad  preferably ones which could not be stopped by america in case of conflict over taiwan.
the submarine incident was put down to a  technical error  by the chinese government, which apologised to japan.
but even before the incident the people s daily, the government mouthpiece, had commented that competition over the east china sea between the two countries was  only a prelude of the game between china and japan in the arena of international energy .
the brazil trade deal included funding for a joint oil  drilling and pipeline programme at a cost that experts said would add up to three times the cost of simply buying oil on the market.
the west, however, has paid little attention to these developments.
for the united states and europe are far more concerned with the even more sensitive issues of china s relations with  pariah states .
in september, china threatened to veto any move to impose sanctions on sudan over the atrocities in darfur.
it has invested 3 billion in the african country s oil industry, which supplies it with seven per cent of its needs.
then, this month, it said that it opposed moves to refer iran s nuclear stand  off with the international atomic energy agency to the united nations security council.
a week before, china s second biggest state oil firm had signed a  70 billion deal for oilfield and natural gas development with iran, which already supplies 13 per cent of china s needs.
china has its own reserves of oil and natural gas and once was a net oil exporter.
but as its economy has expanded by an average of nine per cent per year for the last two decades, so has its demand for energy.
this year it overtook japan as the world s second largest consumer of energy, behind the us.
its projected demand, boosted by a huge rise in car ownership as well as the need to find alternatives to polluting coal for electricity generation, has contributed to the surge in the price of oil this year.
shortages are already leading to power cuts in the big cities.
since president hu ordered state  owned oil firms to  go abroad  to ensure supply, they have begun drilling for gas in the east china sea, just west of the line that japan regards as its border.
japan protested, to no avail, that the project should be a joint one.
the two are also set to clash over russia s oil wealth.
china is furious that japan has outbid it in their battle to determine the route of the pipeline that russia intends to build to the far east.
japan favoured a route to the sea, enabling oil to be shipped to both japan and china.
china wanted an overland route through its own territory, which would give it ultimate control if hostilities broke out.
increasingly, analysts are saying that china s efforts have gone beyond what is safe or even in its own interests.
claude mandil, the executive director of the international energy agency in paris, said the reserves in the east china sea were hardly worth the trouble.
nobody thinks that there will be a lot of oil and gas in this part of the world,  he said.
it may be a difficult political issue but i do nt think the energy content is worthwhile.
eurasia group, a new york  based firm of political analysts, said its oil experts worked out that china was paying such an inflated price for its investment in brazil that the cost for the oil it ended up with was three times the market price.
if china s economy falters, which, in my view, appears increasingly likely, then commodity prices will plummet, and with them, the value of the assets that produce them,  jason kindopp, eurasia s lead china analyst, said.
beijing may end up in a early 1990s japan situation, where it is forced to sell recently purchased overseas assets for a fraction of what it paid for them.
china s wider aggression to secure oil and gas was the greatest threat to its international standing in the next decade.
sudan is the primary example,  he said.
it marks the first time in recent years that china has promised to wield its veto power in the un security council against a petition initiated by the united states and backed by france and great britain.

visualizations as a helpful beginning technique

if you consider that you still need the assistance of other visualizations to help the mind feel the spirit of transcendence, try the following before moving onto the more formal method below.
visualisations can be as useful tools, but meditation is more than that.
meditation has to do with what is called ideation.
it is always good to stick to a formal intense meditation practice like the one for beginners described in the mp3 file that follows after the visualisations.
find a comfortable place on the floor and sit with your legs crossed.
place your hands one on top of the other in your lap, keep your back straight, eyes closed and tongue on the roof of your mouth.
your breathing should be calm and relaxed, through the nose.
spend a minute or so concentrating on your breath, feeling the air flowing through your nostrils.
1. warm sun visualization
continue to breathe slowly and deeply.
with each breath, feel the muscles in your body becoming lighter and lighter, and also your external motor and sensory organs are feeling like they are withdrawing from the world into a special inner quietness.
imagine the tension melting away as you continue breathing rhythmically and naturally.
picture yourself sitting on a warm, tropical beach basking in the glow of the sun ....
visualize the vivid, beautiful colours of the earth  its flowers and plants , the sea next to you, and the sky above you.
feel yourself floating above the earth and sea.
as you sit above the world, the warmth of the golden sun penetrates your body and makes you feel warmer and warmer.
it surrounds you.
the golden rays feel soft and soothing.
now you are far above the earth  into space.
everything around you is so vast.
yet, there is warmth and a familiarity with the vastness.
you want to merge your mind with the greater universal mind that surrounds you.
continue to ideate on this intense desire for your mind to merge with the that universal consciousness.
and while doing so continue using the baba nam kevalam mantra  breathe in with baba nam, breathe out with kevalam .
try this for5 to 10 minutes.
now come back to earth again  slowly.
imagine yourself sitting on the beach serenely and restfully.
your muscles are loose and limp.
feel your body sinking slightly into the sand making that earthly connection again.
the sun s rays and warmth are still with you, surrounding you.
you are in a state of peace and relaxation.
with each breath, watch your body and ensure that it remains relaxed  at peace.
continue to feel the warmth of the sunlight all over your body, warming you deeply and gently.
you want to bring something back with you from your deep space experience where you sensed your mind merging with the universal mind.
this will be the warmth of the sun  a close reminder and link between earth and the infinite space.
visualize the inside of your body bathed in the golden light, absorbing every ray and glowing as radiantly as the sun.
a warm, gentle breeze swirls around your body and relaxes you even more.
let your mind and body be totally at peace.
now feel yourself returning to where you sit ... move your hands and feet a little, stretch them.
open your eyes.
2. mountain visualization
another thing you can try.
imagine you re sitting on top of a mountain, and that it s the most peaceful place you can think of.
feel that you re sitting there in complete peace, right on top of the world.
now imagine that infinite happiness is surrounding you in every direction.
feel you re completely surrounded by that infinite peace and happiness.
now start to repeat within your mind the mantra  baba nam kevalam.
its meaning is  infinite happiness is everywhere .
feel the meaning, do nt just think of its wordy meaning or try to translate from sanskrit  baba nam kevalam  to an english meaning  infinite peace and happiness .
think internally, intuitively, not by words, of the meaning, as you re repeating it.
this is called ideation.
it is important to take the idea, not just the intellectual analysis.
touching deep into the idea is what builds intuition  it is a synthetic process.
whereas, trying to translate and grapple with wordy meanings is an intellectual mechanism  an analytical process.
feel you re surrounded by infinite peace and happiness, and feel that your own sense of existence is in direct contact with that endless peace and happiness all around you.
you can go further and feel that your unit consciousness, a dot in the infinite consciousness, is merging with infinity.
continue for as long as you like, then open your eyes.
ok that is fairly basic .
the important point is to develop some psychospiritual connection between your mind and the universal consciousness or supreme consciousness.
do nt worry if you have trouble concentrating on the mantra and ideation  that s normal.
it takes some time and practice to be able to focus on the one thought.
the main thing is to keep practicing.
if you do nt practice, then nothing happens.
well maybe a miracle could happen, but let s face it we re ordinary people and so require practical day to day techniques

north carolina religious coalition for marriage equality
from what we hear from the news media, one could easily conclude that all christians are opposed to gay marriage.
but that s not the case.
last year an organization named the north carolina religious coalition for marriage equality was formed to get out the message that at least some people of faith are not opposed to extending the rights and responsibilities of civil marriage to same  gender couples.
one of  ncrc4me s  major efforts is to collect signatures for the attached  declaration of religious leaders,  which has been and will again be presented to members of the nc legislature.
it presents the case for marriage equality and states,  we are resolved that the state should not interfere with same  gender couples who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights, responsibilities, and commitments of civil marriage.
a measure to amend the nc constitution to ban gay marriage was defeated last year but already has been reintroduced in the 2005 legislative session, so there is a real need for visible support for the  prosame  gender  marriage  side of this issue.
at its february meeting the chs vestry voted unanimously to add their names to the declaration.
our rector barbara and our deacon clare also have signed the declaration.
furthermore, the vestry voted unanimously to invite the support of members of the chs congregation for the declaration.
since the declaration is written as coming from  religious leaders,  people who do nt consider themselves  religious leaders  can sign as  supporters of the north carolina religious coalition for marriage equality.
please note that the declaration addresses only civil marriage  it says nothing about religious beliefs or practices regarding marriage.
if you have any questions please feel free to call me  after sat. the 26th, when i will return from a trip .
sign  up lists will be available at the services on feb. 27 and march6, or you can email me.
i will email names and email addresses  or postal addresses  of signers to ncrc4me in time for their  lobby day  in raleigh on march 15.
thank you for your consideration of this issue.
for the church of the holy spirit vestry,

north carolina religious coalition for marriage equality declaration of religious leaders april 19, 2004
the most fundamental human right, after the necessities of food, clothing and shelter, is the right to affection and the supportive love of other human beings.
we become most fully human when we love another person.
we can grow in our capacity to be human  to be loving  in a family unit.
this right to love and form a family is so fundamental that our united states constitution takes it for granted in its dedication to  secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.
the north carolina constitution likewise affirms the  inalienable rights  of human beings to  life, liberty, the enjoyment of the fruits of their own labor, and the pursuit of happiness.
throughout history, tyrants have known that by denying the right of oppressed peoples to form and nurture families, they can kill the spirit of those peoples.
from the shameful history of slavery in america, the injustice of forbidding people to marry is evident as a denial of a basic human right.
the american laws forbidding interracial marriage, now struck down, were clearly discriminatory.
denial of the status of marriage to those who would freely accept its responsibilities creates legal and economic inequities and social injustice.
we feel called to protest and oppose this injustice.
as religious people, clergy and lay leaders, we are mandated by faith to stand for justice in our common civic life.
we oppose the use of sacred texts and religious traditions to deny legal equity to same  gender couples.
as concerned citizens we affirm the liberty of adults of the same gender to love and marry.
we insist that no one, especially the state, is allowed to coerce people into marriage or bar two consenting adults, whether of the same or differing genders, from forming the family unit that lets them be more fully loving, thus more fully human.
we respect the fact that debate and discussion continue in many of our religious communities as to the scriptural, theological and liturgical issues involved.
however, we draw on our many faith traditions to arrive at a common conviction.
we are resolved that the state should not interfere with same  gender couples who choose to marry and share fully and equally in the rights, responsibilities, and commitments of civil marriage.
we affirm freedom of conscience in this matter.
we recognize that the state may not require religious groups to officiate at, or bless, same  gender marriages.
likewise, a denial of state civil recognition dishonors the religious convictions of those communities and clergy who officiate at, and bless, same  gender marriages.
the state may not favor the convictions of one religious group over another by denying individuals their fundamental right to marry and to have those marriages recognized by civil law.
as faith leaders, we commit ourselves to public action, visibility, education, and mutual support in the service of the right and freedom to marry.

the one reason why all americans should oppose the nomination of samuel alito
he would tear down our system of checks and balances, giving far too much power to the president
my fellow americans
as many of you may have heard, president bush has nominated a long  time federal judge named samuel alito to become the next member of the united states supreme court, to fill a vacancy created by the retirement of another member of the court.
under our constitution, this nomination can not take effect unless and until the united states senate gives its consent, as described in our constitution, article ii, section2.
a copy of the constitution, with links back to the official source, is located at httploveallpeople.orgusconstitutiona.txt
judge samuel alito is very highly qualified by all of the normal standards used to evaluate candidates for this position
he has a very high intellect.
he graduated very high in his class, from princeton undergraduate and from law school at yale.
he has a long and distinguished record, including many years as a federal appeals judge, the next level below supreme court.
he has encyclopedic knowledge of hundreds of different supreme court cases, and he can recite details from memory.
he demonstrates an excellent  judicial temperament,  being courteous, mild  mannered, respectful of all people  careful in his work, meticulous in detail.
his coworkers love him.
his fellow judges love him.
his family loves him.
president bush loves him.
yes, it is true that some people do nt like the way they think he will vote on the supreme court.
but other people do like the way they think he will vote, and the ones who favor him seem to outnumber the ones who oppose him.
so now the senate is getting ready to vote soon, on whether to approve him or not  and at this moment  evening of jan. 27, 2006  it looks like he has more than the fifty  one votes needed for approval.
the president is very eager to go ahead quickly and get this vote, because he very much wants to have samuel alito on the supreme court, to be judging the cases bush is interested in.
so there is a lot of hurry  up pressure on the senate to give its prompt vote of approval.
there is an old saying that applies in this situation   act in haste, repent at leisure.
sometimes you can make a bad decision very quickly, then regret it for many years to come.
that is what is about to happen with judge samuel alito, in my opinion, because he has one tragic flaw  a very serious blind spot in his thinking  which makes him completely unacceptable for the position of supreme court justice  he does not really agree with the system of  checks and balances  built into the constitution, and he is ready to start tearing it down in order to follow the  unitary executive theory,  which calls for vastly  increased presidential power at the expense of congress and the supreme court.
and because of this tragic flaw...
he would tear down our system of checks and balances, giving far too much power to the president.
in our constitutional system, we have three branches of the federal government  the legislative, executive, and judicial branches.
and the basic idea behind the checks and balances we have is that if one branch of the government goes crazy, the other two can hold it down.
but samuel alito believes in a little  known constitutional theory  called the  unitary executive theory   which says that the president should have complete control over the executive branch, and that the executive branch should be in charge of almost everything that the government actually does, including the functions of the independent agencies which were designed to be free of presidential control, and the military, which exists, which is regulated, and which is funded by specific authority given by the constitution to congress, not to the president.
the military is not part of the executive branch  it is a separate entity.
commander in chief  does nt mean that he is the boss of the military, merely that he is the administrator, just as he is the administrator of the executive branch, charged with  executing faithfully  all the laws passed by congress and all the decisions rendered by the supreme court.
under the unitary executive theory, the laws of congress and decisions of the supreme court have no actual authority unless the president agrees with them.
and so congress and the supreme court become mere advisors to the president, with no real authority over him.
and the president becomes a dictator, unrestrained by anything in the constitution, backed up by the armed forces, which would be entirely under his personal control.
and thus the united states of america  the land of the free and the home of the brave  becomes just another military dictatorship, no better than nazi germany or fascist italy during world war ii.
and that is why all americans should oppose the nomination of samuel alito.

nasa  company diplomacy  trying to keep moon landing hoax a secret in modern times
some strategies being used by nasa  company in relation to china and other space planning countries are mentioned here after being gleaned from a news item underneath.
country has an independent strategy  nasa  company to use  numero uno  strategy, try to assert, beat, mesh and control the space program of the country.
this can also be through political, economical, social, and technological influence.
country not open or not have fixed strategy  nasa  company to use  freeze thawed  strategy especially when the country has a challenging, growing and ambitious space program.
this can also be through political, economical, social, and technological influence.
dependant  nasa  company to use  space station  model to unify the aims of different countries.
this is really an end goal aim of nasa  company and also does not allow anyone challenging the moon landing hoax.
the target for nasa  company probably to get by 2018 all the ambitious space program countries shifting towards this model, through the propaganda of another moon mission  deliberately failing this or trying hard for another moon landing hoax  achieving the real aim of space unity between space programs of other countries.
china launches its second manned spaceflight mission
secretive efforts keep outsiders in the dark about the program s goals
by mark carreau
copyright 2005 houston chronicle
reuters
china launched shenzhou vi, its second manned spacecraft, early today in northwest china s gansu province.
a pair of military pilots embarked on china s second manned space flight early today, hurtling into orbit on a test mission that could span five days.
the crew of the shenzhou vi spacecraft was identified as fei junlong, 40, and nie haishen, 41, by china s official news agency.
the successful launch from the jiuquan satellite launch center in northwest china follows the solo flight of yang liwei in october 2003.
his one  day mission vaulted his communist homeland into the elite circle of spacefaring nations  russia and the united states  that can launch and sustain humans in space.
most experts believe china intends to develop a small space station of its own over the next several years.
but they remain uncertain about whether china aims to beat the united states to the moon in its secretive space effort.
president bush has directed nasa to return to the moon by 2018 with a new generation of human explorers.
china s  is not a fly  by  night program,  said joan johnson  freese, an expert on national security who follows space developments in the asian nation at the naval war college in newport, r.i.
they are not in any hurry.
they want a program that will be a success,  johnson  freese said.
they are not going to rush it, because they do nt want it to be a budget buster.
economics will be a big determiner in the speed of their program.
china s overtures to join the u.s.  led effort to develop the 16  nation international space station have been thwarted for more than a decade over a range of issues, including the asian country s human rights policies and worries it could acquire technologies that could pose a security threat.
the freeze thawed some after yang s 2003 mission.
china was among 30 nations invited to send a delegate to nasa  sponsored roundtable discussions on bush s strategy to reach the moon with astronauts as the first step in the exploration of mars and other  deep space destinations.
we applaud china s space achievements,  nasa spokesman allard beutel said tuesday.
we wish them a successful return of their astronauts.
he stressed, however, that nasa would not follow this week s chinese mission through formal channels.
at present, there are no plans for additional meetings with foreign powers to discuss the bush exploration initiative or to extend an invitation to china to join the space station partnership, beutel said.
the flight of fei and nie could mark the end of the opening chapter in a three  phase chinese space initiative, johnson  freese said.
the first phase, she said, will demonstrate the capability of a multicompartment spacecraft that will leave a test module in orbit when the two fliers return to earth.
the chinese program s second phase will include spacewalks on future missions and demonstrations of docking and undocking techniques.
the final phase will feature the assembly and operation of a longer  duration space lab.
at least one expert believes china s intentions might include a surprise attempt to circle the moon with astronauts before nasa s planned lunar return.
the americans would be wise to plan accordingly,  said john e. pike, director of the alexandria, va.  based globalsecurity.org, a small national security think tank.
there is always the possibility they could jam us up, make us look like we are not numero uno,  pike said.
during the u.s. and russian lunar race during the cold war, nasa scored an early coup by circling the moon with the apollo8 crew over the 1968 christmas holidays.
as it turned out, the soviets never made it to the moon.
china  could be the second country to do that,  pike said.
they would get in line in front of the russians.
and they would not have to land on the moon to take us down a notch.
pike s concern is based on china s development of a new medium  lift rocket, the long march v, and the construction of a new space launch complex on hainan island in the south china sea.
the two developments, he said, could eventually enable china s space program to mature to the point that experts could assemble and launch from earth s orbit a spacecraft capable of circling the moon with astronauts and returning home.

i m a member of a local animal rights news, and get regular emails from other members and the staff.
recently, i read an email that reported the horrific nightmare civet cats go through by sick losers who put them in sheds and heat the inside of the sheds up to 110 degrees with fires, so that they can periodically scrape the sweat off of their genitals and sell it to corrupt corporations who use it to prolong the scent of perfumes.
the animals eventually die, which is because these demons are so greedy, they want as much of their  product  as they can get, instead of letting the cats go after a point, as an act of humanity, mercy, love.
below i pasted the email text, and it has a link to a website that automatically plays this song the author of the email created.
it has cat s  meowing  for the vocals, and you might really find yourself in those furnaces, feeling and thinking those terrible feelings and thoughts that these cats do before they die.
right now, while we re sitting at our computers enjoying the internet, those innocent, beautiful, loving cats, are dying, somewhere in this troubled world a slow, agonizing death.
the main reason i wrote this post is to ask anyone reading this if they know of some way i can help put a stop to this cat holocaust.
i am serious about doing something.
if i love cats so much, why are nt i doing something
i do nt want to appear before god on judgment day and have to explain why i did nt do anything like this in my life.
any suggestions would be appreciated.
here s the text of the email
hi there,
i read the civet cat story from a little while ago, and tonight, when my mom emailed me about it, i reread it, and went to the website with the song the author of the email created.
well, sure enough, when i heard the cats  meowing,  i imagined the hellish moments these poor beautiful creatures of god were living, what went on in their tiny, sweet little minds, and decided that i want to do something about this torture.
so, if anyone can give me some advice, i d sure appreciate it
i think for starters, myself and those of you who believe in god could say a special prayer for them.
i will.
i ve pasted the email for those who have nt seen or would like to reread it.
it s also got the website where the song has been uploaded.
i was thinking, that while i m sitting here, relaxing and enjoying myself, those poor innocent animals are being cooked to death with heat in those holocaustesque death chambers.
and what am i doing about it

subject  civet cats, james rachels  a song
this is my first time posting to the list, so i feel somewhat embarrassed by  promoting  a song i wrote, but i think it is fitting because it is directly tied to extreme animal suffering as a result of human lack of empathy, but an abundance of human greed.
i m not sure if any of you know much about civet cats, but to brief those who might not know, i will quote james rachels, author of world hunger and moral obligation among many other animal rights  related books and articles.
i kind of see him to be for animal rights theory as peter singer is to the theory of utilitarianism applied to nonhuman animals .
the quote is from an article entitled  vegetarianism and  the other weight problem
if anyone wants the complete article, email me, as it is a very good article which no meat  eater can read and not sense their own hypocrisy.
but this is what he says about civet cats
as an example, consider the treatment of the civet cat, a highly intelligent and sociable animal.
civet cats are trapped and placed in small cages inside darkened sheds, where the temperature is kept up to 110 f by fires.
they are confined in this way until they finally die.
what justifies this extraordinary mistreatment
these animals have the misfortune to produce a substance that is useful in the manufacture of perfume.
musk, which is scraped from their genitals once a day for as long as they can surv ive, makes the scent of perfume last a bit longer after each application.
the heat increases their  production  of musk.
here kant s rule   animals are merely means to an end  that end is man   is applied with a vengeance.
to promote one of the most trivial interests we have, thousands of animals are tormented for their whole lives.
this article, and specifically this piece, effected me enough to try to build a song around the topic.
if anyone is interested in listening to this song, and in offering their opinion, whether it be positive or negative, i d appreciate it.
but i also hope no one feels any obligation to download, especially if you have an internet connection as slow mine  28 k .
the url for the song is httpwww.sonic.netfsjobtragicorethecivetcat.mp3
although there are no human vocals  lyrics, i think its subject matter is audible.
again, if anyone wants to read rachels  entire article, let me know.
it s also on the net.
i was already a vegetarian when i read it a little more than a year ago, but it was one of the bigger factors for me in going completely vegan.
i hope all are well.
farewell for now ...

note to wigner  do you think your friend could feed my cat
heisenberg was nt sure.
thanks,
shrodinger

. go vegan.
make thousands
this is not a scam
i found this on a bulletin board and decided to try it  i do nt care about the useless prefabricated crap this message usually says.
all i say is, it works.
continue prefab crap.
well guess what
within seven days, i started getting money in the mail
i was shocked
i figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in.
in my first week, i made about  25.00.
by the end of the second week i had made a total of more than  1000.00
in the third week i had more than  10,000.00 and it s still growing
this is now my fourth week and i have made a total of  42,000.00 and it s still coming rapidly.
it s certainly worth  6.00 and six stamps, and i have spent more than that on the lottery without ever winning
let me tell you how this works and most important, why it works ..........
also make sure you print this out now, so you can get the information off of it, as you will need it.
i promise you that if you follow the directions exactly that you will start making more money than you thought possible by doing something so easy
suggestion  read this entire message carefully
print it out or download it
follow the simple directions and watch the money come in
it s easy.
it s legal.
and, your investment is only  6.00  plus postage
important
this is not a rip  off, it is decent  it s legal  and it is virtually no risk  it really works
if all the following instructions are adhered to, you will receive extraordinary dividends.
please note
please follow the directions exactly, and  50,000 or more can be yours in 20 to 60 days.
this program remains successful because of the honesty and integrity of the participants.
please continue its success by carefully adhering to the instructions.
you will now become a part of the mail order business.
you are in the business of developing mailing lists.
many large corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality lists.
however, the money made from the mailing lists is secondary to income which is made from people like you and me asking to be included in that list.
here are the four easy steps to success.
step one
get six separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece of paper  please put me on your mailing list.
now get6 u.s.  1.00 bills and place one inside of each of the six pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through the envelope  to prevent thievery .
next, place one paper in each of the six envelopes and seal them.
you now should have six sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase, your name and address, and a  1.00 bill.
what you are doing is creating a service.
this is absolutely legal
you are requesting a legitimate service and you are paying for it
like most of us i was a little skeptical and little worried about the legal aspects of it all.
so i checked it out with the u.s. post office  18002385355  and they confirmed that it is indeed legal
mail the six envelopes to the following addresses

blue planet  who s afraid of big bad wolf
by dan whipple
united press international
boulder, co, feb. 23  upi
ever since he ate up red riding hood s grandma and blew down the houses of two  thirds of the three little pigs, the big bad wolf has held a persistently bad reputation.
in part because of that reputation, the gray wolf was nearly exterminated from the lower 48 states by the 1920s, except for a small remnant population on isle royale national park in michigan s lake superior.
the last wolf was killed in yellowstone national park in 1943.
western sheep and cattle ranchers, on whose behalf this extermination campaign was conducted, gratefully dusted their hands of the wolf and wrote him off as a job well done.
their sheep could graze, their cows could ruminate and never a discouraging word would be heard.
after the major kill  offs, wolves outside of alaska and canada existed mostly as legend.
like ufos or sasquatch, several people claimed to see fleeting lone wolves, usually in yellowstone.
in the 1960s, a group shooting a movie in the wyoming park reportedly imported some captive wolves, then released them when their shooting was done.
if so, this happy band has not been heard from since.
rumor also had it some renegade biologist brought a caged pair to yellowstone and released them into the wild sometime in the 1970s, hoping to reestablish a breeding population.
if true, the caper failed.
over time, the wolf s absence seemed to rehabilitate its image.
eventually, a trickle of support appeared for bringing the predator back to its former home range in the northern rocky mountains.
this trickle grew into a flood, resulting in 14 wolves being reintroduced in yellowstone in 1995 by the u.s. fish and wildlife service  albeit over the strong and still  continuing objections of ranchers.
these wolf packs have flourished, and now there are an estimated 850 wolves roaming the northern rockies, where merely 10 years ago there were none.
one compelling argument for reintroduction was the wolf acts as a keystone predator, an animal that affects the populations, behavior and ecology of a wide variety of species within its range.
some recent research conducted by oregon state university has given considerable credence to this idea.
osu forestry professors william ripple and robert beschta have found that wolves actually promote stream  bank stabilization, although they have given the phenomenon the unfortunate name of  the ecology of fear   something that smacks of the horrible pr resulting from the wolf s relationships with riding hood and the three pigs.
they explained that elk in yellowstone used to browse unmolested on young aspen and willow growing near the banks of streams, a behavior that prevented the saplings from reaching mature stages and increased the possibility of soil erosion.
since reintroduction, however, ripple and beschta have found, fear of the wolves apparently has discouraged the elk from spending too much time at stream banks  where they are out in the open  and munching on the saplings.
all you have to do is look at the photographs,  ed bangs, wolf recovery coordinator for the u.s. fish and wildlife service, told upi s blue planet,
you say,  wow
an area that used to be bald as a billiard ball is now a sea of willow.
this simple change has triggered a veritable ecological cascade in yellowstone.
more streamside willow and aspen have meant better habitat for beaver, for instance.
where there had been only one beaver colony in the park s northern range before the wolves returned, now there are nine.
it may be uninteresting to a lot of people,  beschta told blue planet.
there s a lot of impact on plants and they say,  who cares
but we ve been looking at streamside communities.
since wolf recovery, streamside plants, willows and cottonwoods provide food for other critters  beavers, a whole variety of avian species, berry  producing shrubs that bears can use.
it s important with regard to the quality of streams.
the plants provide shade and root strength for bank stability.
plants are critical to wildland ecosystems.
yellowstone has a vast elk herd, one of the largest in the world.
bangs said although the number of elk has not declined very much since the wolves came back, their behavior appears markedly different.
i m pretty suspicious of making broad generalizations,  however, he cautioned.
wolves are still pretty new.
they ve only been there for 10 years.
in 10 more years we ll have a better idea.
wolf reintroduction in the northern rockies has been so successful the fish and wildlife service has moved to reduce the animal s status from endangered to threatened and, eventually, to remove it from the endangered species list altogether.
bangs said the agency has established viable wolf packs in the northern rockies, as required by federal regulations.
some conservationists want the protection extended so wolves can move into other states, including colorado, utah and oregon, among others.
on jan. 31, oregon federal district court judge robert e. jones appeared to agree with them.
he vacated the fws decision to downgrade the wolf s status.
bangs said his agency is still reviewing the decision.
regardless of the wolf s legal status, its future expansion into new areas now seems likely.
wolves can migrate considerable distances.
a yellowstone wolf was found dead, hit by a car, on a colorado highway last year, several hundred miles from home.
meanwhile, his reputation seems to be improving, although bangs noted a  pretty interesting social dynamic.
there are only about 850 wolves in the west, but there are an estimated 31,000 mountain lions.
pound for pound, mountain lions eat more game and more livestock than wolves.
they even occasionally attack people, which wolves do not  despite the propaganda from the brothers grimm.
yet people seem willing  even eager  to accommodate mountain lions, despite the risks.
it remains to be seen whether they will extend the same courtesy to the arriving gray wolf.
regarding those rumors about wolves living in yellowstone prior to the official reintroduction
they seem to be just that  rumors.
true, there are about 300,000 wolves and wolf hybrids kept as pets in the united states.
it also is likely people have released some of these animals into the wild hoping they would survive  for instance, a ranger in glacier park caught someone in this very act not long ago.
bangs said these animals are not equipped to survive in the wild, however, and they all almost certainly have died.
he said after 10 years of dna testing on northern rockies wolves, scientists have not found a single strain that did not belong to one of the wolves the agency released  or their descendants.

climate  humans fuss, animals adjust
by dan whipple
united press international
boulder, co, nov. 15  upi
scientists can argue all they want about how many degrees celsius  or fahrenheit  the planet is warming and what the trend portends, but meanwhile earth s plants, insects and animals are not waiting for the outcome.
they already are altering their patterns of behavior in response to what is happening.
it turns out one of the surest barometers of the warming climate is the response of the nonhuman natural world to changing conditions, and biologists who study the responses have been aware for some years the biosphere is acknowledging global warming.
nina leopold bradley, a plant ecologist and daughter of the conservation pioneer aldo leopold, published a 1999 paper in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences on her 61  year uninterrupted phenological records.
phenology studies an organism s development and life cycle  the pulse of life.
bradley s record of 300 phenophases found that even prior to 1999, spring was arriving in higher latitudes several weeks earlier than in the earlier years of her data.
birds arrived sooner on their migrations from the south and plants flowered earlier.
the eastern phoebe is showing up about 20 days before it used to.
the forest phlox is blooming in late april instead of midmay.
half of the 300 phenophases leopold tracked showed a response consistent with warming.
in england, the cuckoo returns earlier.
an analysis of 65 bird species in the united kingdom shows about one  third are laying their eggs four to seven days earlier than they did 25 years ago.
one of the major, most well  documented and robust findings in ecology over the past century has been the crucial role of climate in determining the geographical distribution of species and ecological communities,  concluded a report titled  observed impacts of global climate change in the united states,  released by the pew center on global climate last week.
pew researchers looked at about 40 studies that could provide an assessment of whether climate was affecting biology.
half of the studies provide strong evidence of a causal link between the biological change and climate change,  said camille parmesan, a university of texas  austin biologist and one of the world s leading experts on this issue.
these changes are occurring across all species, parmesan told upi s climate.
across the united states, the northern edge of species  range is expanding,  she said.
parmesan has spent much of her career studying the checkerspot butterfly, which migrates between mexico and southern california.
some localized extinctions already have occurred across some of its habitat.
empirical research pointed to climate as being a strong driver,  she said.
there have been large numbers of population extinctions in mexico and southern california in areas where the habitat is still acceptable.
according to parmesan s earlier studies, one extinction event, for instance, was triggered when a checkerspot population migrated north prematurely, relying on a warming temperature signal, then was caught in a severe snowstorm in its northern habitat.
throughout the united states, she said,  spring is about two weeks earlier.
tree swallows are nesting nine days earlier.
tropical species have moved up to florida and the gulf coast.
bird and butterfly watchers are seeing many, many new species coming up from mexico and the caribbean.
as the pew report concluded,  sufficient studies now exist to conclude that the consequences of climate change are already detectable within u.s. ecosystems.
such consequences include shifting and, in some cases, contraction of ranges and changes in species composition within ecosystems.
the report also found alterations of ecosystem processes such as carbon cycling and storage.
the alaskan tundra, for instance, has switched from being a net sink of carbon dioxide  absorbing and storing more carbon from the atmosphere than it releases  to  being a net source of co2  releasing more carbon than is stored  because warmer winters have allowed dead plant matter previously stored in the soil to decompose and release co2.
the pew report coincided with the release in iceland of the  arctic climate impact assessment.
the acia  with participation by the united states, canada, denmark, finland, iceland, norway, the russian federation and sweden  was begun in 2000.
the impacts of global warming are affecting people now in the arctic,  said acia chair robert corell.
the arctic is experiencing some of the most rapid and severe climate change on earth.
the impacts of climate change on the region and the globe are projected to increase substantially in the years to come.
the acia found arctic winter temperatures have increased4 degrees to7 degrees fahrenheit in the last 50 years and should go up about twice that much in the next 100 years.
arctic summer sea ice will decline by 50 percent by the end of the 21st century, the assessment found, with some models predicting complete disappearance of summer sea ice.
should the arctic ocean become ice  free in summer, it is likely that polar bears and some seal species would be driven toward extinction,  the report concluded.
as with so much climate research, not everyone agrees with these dire predictions.
a third report,  the impacts of climate change  an appraisal for the future,  completed by the britain  based international policy network and released almost simultaneously with the other two, falls somewhat into that category.
on the one hand, the ipn report agreed  climate models generally predict that the temperature rises in the arctic will substantially exceed the global rise.
this applies especially in the high arctic where the ice cover is expected to diminish substantially with the effect that the surface absorption of solar radiation will greatly increase.
on the other hand, the report thinks the news might not be so bad for the north atlantic fisheries.
the impact of global warming on fish stocks and fisheries is hard to judge,  the ipn report said.
a warming of the magnitude predicted is more likely than not to be beneficial to the fisheries of the north atlantic.
the important commercial species that probably would benefit from warming include cod, haddock, saithe, herring, blue whiting and several types of flatfish and crustaceans  such as the norway lobster.
important species that probably would decline include shrimp, capelin, greenland halibut and some varieties of flatfish.
hidden in this laundry list  and in the pile of studies examined by the pew researchers  is one of the fundamental chasms dividing participants in the global warming debate.
the ipn report examines commercial fish species, but it neglects important noncommercial animals, such as seals and polar bears.
in a limited economic sense, therefore, the organization can argue warming might be a good thing.
the problem is whether one cares what happens to the polar bears, checkerspot butterflies and other unconsumables.
the pew researchers tried to transcend the economic argument.
they assumed a value  unspecified  for noncommercial species, and in doing so rendered the warming news a bit less rosy.
this tug  of  war over calculating economic values is the one that ultimately will have to be decided by humans, because animals and plants can adjust only so much.
when dandelions have set the mark of may on wisconsin pastures, it is time to listen for the final proof of spring,  wrote aldo leopold in  a sand county almanac.
sit down on a tussock, cock your ears at the sky, dial out the bedlam of meadowlarks and redwings, and soon you may hear it  the flight of the upland plover, just now back from the argentine.
or maybe not.

preamble from bbc leading to the comments further below.
feel free to cut and paste and leave your comments, as these viewpoints cover the entire gamut surrounding the event.

how has katrina changed the us
what will be the lasting effects of hurricane katrina and what can be learnt from the response
relief agencies are trying to help hundreds of thousands of displaced people while authorities have vowed to restore security in new orleans following a breakdown of law and order.
in the world press, commentators predict that katrina will make a profound change in the way the us is perceived at home and abroad, especially following the scenes of poverty and racial divisions they believe the disaster has revealed.
meanwhile, president george w bush has said he will lead an inquiry into how the disaster was handled.
how has katrina changed the us
has it altered your life
has the disaster affected the way other countries view the us
send us your comments using the form.

some of the better comments
as an american, i would like to take this opportunity to tell all the  usa and bush bashers  that i am appalled at the number of  allies  that are using this disaster as their podium to spread their useless opinions.
what you see in new orleans is a perfect example of the downfalls of the welfare system, a form of socialism that many in this country know is the true problem.
you have seen the pictures.
you people think it is race, but it is not.
it is the welfare society that was new orleans.
paul, atlanta, usa
i am frankly revolted by the response of the bush  bashers   sorry chaps, but you did have it coming ...
the plain fact is that bush has a sight more in the way of common humanity than a great many of his detractors.
at least he is nt using this disaster for cheap political point  scoring.
mac, nottingham
i do not feel it has changed the us citizens which is what was needed, even now the majority want  gas  despite the fact they are polluting the world more than any other country in the world and refuse to stop, perhaps this natural disaster, which let s face it looks like a product of global warming, will change their views, why not pick things up with your hands and walk with your legs, other people in the world do it,  gas  is not the be all and end all
david, kent
this man has clearly never visited the us.
distances are not what they are in the old world.
here, cars are absolutely necessary, and he d have to have one, too.
juggernaut
the us will work its way through the loss of a city and we are making progress after seven short days.
thank you for your concern, but europe is still irrelevant.
john b, windermere, florida
john can come over to eat at my house anytime.
juggernaut
it is always interesting what spin the press will take.
certainly, representation of the us in other countries will have a certain depiction.
i do nt believe that folks who believe that america is the land of opportunity will change their views from this recent news.
i have a friend who came here from bulgaria after winning a green card in a lottery.
yes, she and her family were delighted to leave the communistic remnants in that country.
her husband became a citizen of the us just the week before last.
believe it or not, it takes a minimum of5 years to apply.
the countries which are giving to america to aid are a great example of the seed that america has sown through the years with other nations.
now to the poverty stricken and the racial issue ...
you know, i ve lived in the dallas  fort worth metroplex most of my life.
when not in texas, i lived in la and san francisco.
there is a lot of racial diversity in all of these places ... and i ve vacationed through the south ... visited my folks when they lived in mississippi, and where they live now and are in the racial minority being white  less than 20   in northeastern arkansas.
the fact is, when i began traveling for business to new england, when i first visited my in  laws in montana and idaho, i was shocked at the lack of racial diversity.
i did nt expect to react that way, but when i was looking around my workplace in nashua, new hampshire, and everyone else looked pretty much like me, it was really very eerie.
so, yes, america has pockets that are more diverse than others.
additionally, reviewing the standings of louisiana and mississippi in the educational stakes, you ll find they usually land near the bottom of a list of 50 states.
unfortunately, those left behind to be filmed, where those without transportation or means.
some refused to leave, but so many were unable to.
yes, it s a valid reflection of america  we do have cities like this.
however, new orleans also had many affluent people, people who left town early as they had the means.
i do nt know if this will change other nation s perceptions of america.
i suspect it will not change greatly ... but you never know how much stock people put in the news.
i do know that this will change the face of america.
i expect that many of the displaced people  those affluent and those not  will remain in the places they were evacuated to.
the 1.25 million people who have been housed in stadiums and convention centers across texas will begin to populate houston, dallas, san antonio and galveston, and the surrounding areas.
sure, some will return, but i have a feeling that once many begin to get jobs and temporary housing, they may be shy about returning.
i m interested in what america will look like in5 years.
will racial diversity find its way to wyoming as some people are offered jobs there
or will the nearly year  round snow be too much for those who have never experienced snow in their lives
will the housing market in dallas begin booming like the rest of the nation has due to the influx of buyers
will businesses that were new in 2005 have become a household name due to their efforts in rebuilding the gulf coast
what will the federal government do to prevent inflation in the housing and building market
these are some of the things i ve been wondering ...
linna
response coming soon.
your reply is good and deserves something good in return.
juggernaut
okay, i m new to this forum and really do nt like bush, so my view point is slanted and i admit that.
i rarely listen to the news or to what politicians or lawyers say because so many tell lies that none have credibility so what s the point
what i know is that i have a close friend whos aunt disappeared in new orleans.
my friend did nt have computer capability, so i spent the day searching and posting online.
the family here  california  wanted to fly any family members from there to ca, so they could remain here until things got straightened out down there.
the cousins could not be found because no one was sure of their married names.
the hope was that anyone looking for the aunt would see the family post and know that help was available.
it is oct.6, and not one family member has been located.
what i saw was dozens of school buses submerged that could have been used to evacuate people who had no transportation.
what i heard was the mayor of new orleans, saying that he did nt order the buses or anything else to be used because he was waiting on someone else to tell him what to do.
when common sense takes a back seat to politics and legal mumbo jumbo what have we become
recently, bush addressed the nation.
about 30 seconds into his address, he started flogging the terrorist issue just one more time.
ironically he almost burst out laughing and it was all he could do to keep his mirth down to a barely controlled smirk.
even he ca nt believe that he is trotting out this old saw again.
i guess if you have a schtick that is a resounding success once, you ca nt help but trot it out every time your act is going sour.
meanwhile, every pocket that can be lined is golden and the poor are shunted off radar yet again.
the gall of it all is that bush is stumping for more money to build more refineries, when what he should do is pour money into making the us independent of opec or crude oil all together.
we have the technology  if you are going to spend billions of dollars touting  freedom  why not spend those billions making all of us free
free of polution, free of oil dependency, and free of big business that is bleeding us dry for the short term good  theirs .
i m sorry he makes me want to puke so i shut him off.
in the meanwhile there are still broken families that should have been safe in the home of the brave.
for those who believe ....................

upon the sixth of april, alexander the great was born.

neither was this day less fortunate to his father philip  for on the same day he took potidea    john aubrey, f.r.s.

antonio perez 1535  1611  philip ii s renegade secretary of state
in  love s labour s lost  we find a character don adriana de armatho, full of affection and bombast.
a spanish refugee, antonio perez, visited england in 1593 and became acquainted with francis  anthony bacon, with whom for a time he seems to have been on terms of intimacy, which did not last very long, for the spaniard developed so much affectation  bombast that he became unpopular in court circles.
in 1594 perez wrote  published a book under the assumed name of  raphael peregrino.
in the play holofernes is ridiculing don adriana  the traveler from spain  and says of him   he is too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it were, too peregrinate, as i may call it.
act5, scene1.
to make the reference more pointed and unmistakable, sir nathaniel replies  a most singular  choice epithet,  and at once enters it in his note book.
this parody on perez  sobriquet clearly identifies perez with armatho.

subject  re  facts, purpose of list, italy, jews
there were no jews in england to speak of in the 1590s.
true, but two in england that we know of were a part of the essex entourage  dr. lopez, who had been physician to essex  step  father, the earl of leicester, had apparently treated the young essex for some socially unacceptable ailment, and antonio perez, who was a guest at essex house in the early 1590s.
to be sure, both lopez  perez were conversos  but they were thought of in england as being, as they undoubtedly were, at least ethnically, jews.

doctor roderigo lopez  1525  1594  was the portugese jewish doctor accused by essex of trying to poison queen elizabeth.
the 69 year old dr. lopez was found guilty and was summarily hung and quartered on june7, 1594 at tyburn.
long before  september 1560  dr. lopez had been the personal house doctor of robert dudley and the good doctor was obligated to write the death certificate for amy robsart  stating that she had  accidentally  fallen down the stairs .
that same year  1560  a spanish priest named ruy lopez handily beat all comers at a chess tournament in rome.
lopez s 1561 book  libro de la invencion liberal y arte del juego del acedraz  became the classic on chess openings, including the one that bears his name.

i have told you, friend,  said the curate,  that this is done to divert our idle thoughts  and as in well  ordered states games of chess, fives, and billiards are allowed for the diversion of those who do not care, or are not obliged, or are unable to work, so books of this kind are allowed to be printed, on the supposition that, what indeed is the truth, there can be nobody so ignorant as to take any of them for true stories
well then,  said don quixote,  the same thing happens in the comedy and life of this world, where some play emperors, others popes, and, in short, all the characters that can be brought into a play  but when it is over, that is to say when life ends, death strips them all of the garments that distinguish one from the other, and all are equal in the grave.
a fine comparison   said sancho   though not so new but that i have heard it many and many a time, as well as that other one of the game of chess  how, so long as the game lasts, each piece has its own particular office, and when the game is finished they are all mixed, jumbled up and shaken together, and stowed away in the bag, which is much like ending life in the grave.
thou art growing less doltish and more shrewd every day, sancho,  said don quixote.
ay,  said sancho   it must be that some of your worship s shrewdness sticks to me  land that, of itself, is barren and dry, will come to yield good fruit if you dung it and till it

nostromo a tale of the seaboard
after having written so far, don martin decoud, the exotic dandy of the parisian boulevard, got up and walked across the sanded floor of the cafe at one end of the albergo of united italy, kept by giorgio viola, the old companion of garibaldi.
the highly coloured lithograph of the faithful hero seemed to look dimly, in the light of one candle, at the man with no faith in anything except the truth of his own sensations.
looking out of the window, decoud was met by a darkness so impenetrable that he could see neither the mountains nor the town, nor yet the buildings near the harbour  and there was not a sound, as if the tremendous obscurity of the placid gulf, spreading from the waters over the land, had made it dumb as well as blind....
he turned away.
he could bear no longer that expressionless and motionless stare, which seemed to have a sort of impenetrable emptiness like the black depth of an abyss.
... and uneasy in its corporate expression, was overtopped by the big face of don juste lopez, soft and white, with prominent eyelids and wreathed in impenetrable solemnity as if in a dense cloud.

wisteria lodge
he could do little during the day, for murillo took every precaution and never went out save with his satellite lucas, or lopez as he was known in the days of his greatness.
at night, however, he slept alone, and the avenger might find him.
on a certain evening, which had been prearranged, i sent my friend final instructions, for the man was forever on the alert and continually changed his room.
i was to see that the doors were open and the signal of a green or white light in a window which faced the drive was to give notice if all was safe or if the attempt had better be postponed.
but everything went wrong with us.
in some way i had excited the suspicion of lopez, the secretary.
he crept up behind me and sprang upon me just as i had finished the note.
he and his master dragged me to my room and held judgment upon me as a convicted traitress.
then and there they would have plunged their knives into me could they have seen how to escape the consequences of the deed.
finally, after much debate, they concluded that my murder was too dangerous.
but they determined to get rid forever of garcia.
they had gagged me, and murillo twisted my arm round until i gave him the address.
i swear that he might have twisted it off had i understood what it would mean to garcia.
lopez addressed the note which i had written, sealed it with his sleeve  link, and sent it by the hand of the servant, jose.
how they murdered him i do not know, save that it was murillo s hand who struck him down, for lopez had remained to guard me.
i believe he must have waited among the gorse bushes through which the path winds and struck him down as he passed.
at first they were of a mind to let him enter the house and to kill him as a detected burglar  but they argued that if they were mixed up in an inquiry their own identity would at once be publicly disclosed and they would be open to further attacks.
with the death of garcia, the pursuit might cease, since such a death might frighten others from the task.

the rock revolution happened in the sixties 6, number of the beast .
it came from liverpool, that was the port base to the titanic, destroyed by god because of the arrogant insult of captain smith  also from liverpool    not even god can sink my ship   not only the captain, but also the rest of the crew and even the orchestra playing at the titanic were from liverpool .
the rock revolution came from the nation that allows a church to be changed to a pub or to a dance room or to a recording studio full of drug addicts, homosexuals and lunatics  as that of george martin, ally of the beatles .
it came from the nation whose king enrique viii adulterated the bible so that divorce could be allowed and in this way be able to give loose rein to the many divorces from his wives and subsequent murdering of the same ones and to whom god provided a wife with six fingers as abomination  anne boleyn  ... once again6, number of the beast ....
it is interesting to observe that this nation is nicknamed  the devil s island .
as the epithet of the government of satan on that nation, the center of london, the so well  known piccadilly circus, takes its name from an old brothel  the  piccadilla house  which means  the house of sin  , disappeared nowadays.
the antichrist john lennon, one of the devil s main puppets to destroy family, social and moral values and to begin the disintegration of mankind, did hit stuart sutcliffe  the first bass player of the beatles  in the head with a club repeatedly in hamburg.
some months later sutcliffe died from brain haemorrhage because of john lennon s bruises.
john lennon entered stardom being a murderer.
the same demons that made captain smith say  not even god can sink my ship  spoke from antichrist john lennon  from liverpool, base port to the titanic  saying   christianity is on the go.
it will vanish and shrink.
we are more popular than jesus and pope  ....
that was the day that god s curse fell upon the world of rock.
one week after that declaration, only one week later, brian epstein, forger of the beatle farce, died from an overdose.
from then on, the beatles began to get involved in false religions and to preach them to the world.
john lennon s divorce followed, as well as his entering the world of black magic, as deeply as to buy the apartment. where the  rosemary s baby  had been filmed, previous property of roman polansky, and in that same apartment john lennon had a room upholstered with black silk where he used to do his black magic operations.
came the disintegration of the beatles  minds with lsd which has caused, among others, schizophrenic lyrics such as  i am the walrus  and incoherent schizophrenic musical expositions like  revolution number9 .
at the same time, the devil acted through his other main puppets with  sympathy for the devil  that was when the pact of the rolling stones with satan took the life of the founder of the group, the guitarist brian jones  who refused to be a puppet of the devil , murdered by people sent by mick jagger, another assassin.
antichrist john lennon followed the devil s strategy writing lyrics such as  god is a concept by which we measure our pain ... i do nt believe in jesus, etc., etc.,   god  and  and no religions too ...   imagine .
antichrist john lennon wanted to compete with jesus christ, and so he grew a beard and started to make a bogus role of christ together with yoko ono at the amsterdam hilton hotel proclaiming  peace , being then when he was visited by the canadian journalist who ridiculized and admonished him wanting to know about what lennon meant when he wrote in the lyrics of  the ballad of john and yoko    the way things are going, they re going to crucify me ... , the curse of god upon john lennon carried on with all type of miseries and distresses which made lennon give the interview to the  rolling stone  magazine  today condensed in the  lennon remembers  book  where he speaks about how bad thing were going for him blaming  whatever is up there  for it  referring to god .
the curse of god carried on until he was shot dead.
it is interesting to notice that he was shot seven times, being seven, as well as three, the holy numbers in holy cabalah tradition ....
after george harrison, said arrogantly in a video filmed in his studio at henley on thames   i want to talk about the divinity of man , he was given throat cancer by god because of those words, which made metastasis and carried on to final death ..
to paul mccartney whose company s logo was a person toying with the planets as if he was a god, and who was being very much deluded in his ego trip by the fact that he was made  sir   when in england even the road sweeper is made sir, as long as he produces money for the nation , god provided cancer to the wife.
the advertising farce of how much he loved linda  woman whose quality he did not deserve , was exposed when it was known that paul had an affair with heather mills, linda s intimate friend, with whom mccartney went on a trip to new york and to whom he bought things and presents, while he was still mourning for his  dear linda .
at the same time mccartney was going out with heather mills, he used linda s death for promotional ends, due to his waning popularity.
paul was going out with heather, but in front of the audience he played the faithful husband s masquerade pretending to suffer for linda, for the afore mentioned promotional ends.
paul admitted that he made linda suffer a lot, but he did nt say that it was because he felt insecure as a man due to his womanish face and effeminate manners and also because with his age his sexual power was not the same, even though it has never been much.
the early days were the days of competition between paul and his wife and john and his wife and he knew he had to compete with ugly john for the leadership of the band in front of their wives and having yoko ono made him aware of his lack of virility and repressed homosexuality, he grew the beard that we see in the  let it be  film and started to show pictures of naked women in the same film, doing every effort he could to be seen as a man ....
it is easy to note the uneasiness of mccartney when he sings   i ve got a feeling, a feeling i ca nt hide ...  in front of yoko in the film.
he already had the traumas that his previous girlfriend jane asher had caused him when she made him aware of his little manliness and effeminate manners .
paul has such a big inferiority complex as a man, due to his effeminate face, body and personality and due to his repressed homosexuality, that he found himself a handicapped woman with only one leg, so that he could stand out, being very conscious that a full woman would make him feel the superiority of virile men again, as jane and linda did.
this is something that his ego trip of lucky bad musician could not face anymore ....
he is very conscious that money and fame can not buy virility and manliness.
besides being a murderer, john lennon had sexual intercourse with homosexual brian epstein to get him interested in going to see the band at the cavern, trauma from which he never recovered.
because of the trauma that his homosexual relation with brian epstein had left him, he made lyrics such as   you can wear a collar and a tie, one thing you ca nt hide is when you re crippled inside  and gave declarations to the  rolling stone  magazine saying that  sometimes he wore texan boots to feel more secure as a man .
the beatles are very well known by people close to them for their arrogance and racism.
one of the manifestations of their racism is the rejection towards japanese yoko ono.
that rejection got to the point that george harrison kicked yoko ono in the apple studios during the filming of let it be.
when john asked george while they were having lunch about how things were going for paul after his separation from the beatles and george replied that he was number one in the swedish hit parade, john said in a despective manner   ah  .. in sweden .. , as if sweden was an inferior place or something alike.
in the beatles  song  get back  they advise black joe to  get back to where you once belonged , as if england was not a place for black people.
sometimes back, paul told george in the apple offices that the new generations are a bundle of idiots and useless people, but in any way they would have also been slaves of the beatles.
the jewish marriage living to the right of george s house said that he is an arrogant person who does never return a greeting.
the newly married couple living on the corner in front of the entrance of george s house  friar park  refers to him as an overbearing person to stay away from.
the receptionist of  hand made , the former film making company of george harrison said   we do nt have any relation with that man anymore and we do nt want to know anything about him .
it is interesting to note that this company was made bankrupt by the british cinema industry due to the despotism and pedantry of george harrison, who believed that the cinema industry would have worshiped him.
their chauvinisms got to the point that even they themselves hated each other.
paul mccartney said that george harrison is a nothing.
george harrison said that he is tired of listening to people talk about john lennon ....
george harrison said in a video that  oasis is a very untalented band and they should nt be playing at all , all of it being the truth, but the beatles is also a band of very poor musicians, if musicians at all, who could only play a couple of elementary guitar chords and who are as untalented as oasis.
the beatles of the times of the  cavern  sounded exactly as poorly as oasis and the little musical quality in the songs of the beatles is due to george martin.
without george martin the beatles would have been just another untalented band as oasis ....
paul mccartney said recently that he believes in using magic, and he does lots of charity, thinking that in this way he will compensate for the curse of god that is upon him and that took his wife s life because of his satanism and involvement in black magic.
he thinks he will deceive people in this way, so that the real mccartney will not be perceived.
is the old devil attempting to disguise as good in front of people.
satan deceiving mankind once again, as so many other thousands of times through the centuries ....
after the devil began his devastating job from the ghostly  devil s island  through his nine main puppets  beatles  rolling stones , he possessed an endless amount of other schizophrenic bad musician in the afore mentioned island and weakening their conscience with drugs, he made them proclaimers of homosexuality, aversion to religion, destruction of family values, dissipation, mental illness, antisocialism, etc., etc.,
the fact that bad apprentice musicians such as the beatles and the rolling stones achieved such a giant fame that not even the real quality musicians could achieve, was because the forces of satan were behind everything, supporting the process.
this mentally ill humanity, destroyed families, twisted moral values, manifest or repressed homosexuality in human beings, anti natural feminism rebellion, drug addiction, corrupt social outlines, mad youths without direction, non respect to hierarchies, convulsed nations, misanthropy, misogyny, paedophilia, irrational and feeble lasciviousness and all other type of existent aberrations, are due to the vast manoeuvre that satan executed through his main marionettes the beatles and the rolling stones, from the devil s island.
if you wonder why there is misery and curse in your house, it is because you own some l.p, cd or another article related to the cursed by god beatles and rolling stones.
we recommend you to take that curse out of your house throwing away everything related to the devil s main nine puppets ....

attack on iran  a looming folly
by william rivers pitt
t r u t h o u t  perspective
monday 09 january 2006
the wires have been humming since before the new year with reports that the bush administration is planning an attack on iran.
the bush administration is preparing its nato allies for a possible military strike against suspected nuclear sites in iran in the new year, according to german media reports, reinforcing similar earlier suggestions in the turkish media,  reported upi on december 30th.
the berlin daily der tagesspiegel this week,  continued upi,  quoted  nato intelligence sources  who claimed that the nato allies had been informed that the united states is currently investigating all possibilities of bringing the mullah  led regime into line, including military options.
this  all options are open  line has been president george w bush s publicly stated policy throughout the past 18 months.
an examination of the ramifications of such an attack is desperately in order.
1. blowback in iraq
the recent elections in iraq were dominated by an amalgam of religiously fundamentalist shiite organizations, principally the dawa party and the supreme council for islamic revolution in iraq  sciri .
both dawa and sciri have umbilical connections to the fundamentalist shiite leadership in iran that go back decades.
in essence, iran now owns a significant portion of the iraqi government.
should the united states undertake military action against iran, the ramifications in iraq would be immediate and extreme.
in the first eight days of january, eighteen us troops have been killed in iraq, compounded by another twelve deaths from a black hawk helicopter crash on saturday.
much of the violence aimed at american forces is coming from disgruntled sunni factions that have their own militias, believe the last elections were a sham, and hold little political power in the government.
if the us attacks iran, it is probable that american forces  already taxed by attacks from sunni factions  will also face reprisal attacks in iraq from shiite factions loyal to iran.
the result will be a dramatic escalation in us and civilian casualties, us forces will be required to bunker themselves further into their bases, and us forces will find themselves required to fight the very government they just finished helping into power.
iraq, already a seething cauldron, will sink further into chaos.
2. iran s armaments
unlike iraq, iran has not spent the last fifteen years having its conventional forces worn down by grueling sanctions, repeated attacks, and two american  led wars.
while iran s conventional army is not what it was during the heyday of the iran  iraq war  their armaments have deteriorated and the veterans of that last war have retired  the nation enjoys substantial military strength nonetheless.
according to a report issued by the center for strategic and international studies in december of 2004, iran  has some 540,000 men under arms and over 350,000 reserves.
they include 120,000 iranian revolutionary guards trained for land and naval asymmetrical warfare.
iran s military also includes holdings of 1,613 main battle tanks, 21,600 other armored fighting vehicles, 3,200 artillery weapons, 306 combat aircraft, 60 attack helicopters,3 submarines, 59 surface combatants, and 10 amphibious ships.
iran is now the only regional military power that poses a significant conventional military threat to gulf stability,  continued the csis report.
iran has significant capabilities for asymmetric warfare, and poses the additional threat of proliferation.
there is considerable evidence that it is developing both a long  range missile force and a range of weapons of mass destruction.
it has never properly declared its holdings of chemical weapons, and the status of its biological weapons programs is unknown.
a milnet brief issued in february 2005 reports,  due to its position astride the persian gulf, iran has constantly been a threat to the gulf.
the so called  tanker  wars in the late 1980s put iran squarely in the bullseye of all nations seeking to transport oil out of the region.
even the small navy that iran puts to sea is capable enough to harass shipping, and several cases of small boat operations against oil well heads in the gulf during that period made it clear small asymmetrical tactics of the iranian navy could be quite effective.
more concerning,  continued the milnet brief,  is the priority placed on expanding and modernizing its navy.
the csis report cites numerous areas where iran has funded modernization including the most troublesome aspect, antishipping cruise missiles   iran has obtained new antiship missiles and missile patrol craft from china, midget submarines from north korea, submarines from russia, and modern mines.
it is iran s missile armaments that pose the greatest concern for american forces in the gulf, especially for the us navy.
iran s coast facing the persian gulf is a looming wall of mountains that look down upon any naval forces arrayed in those waters.
the gulf itself only has one exit, the strait of hormuz, which is also dominated by the mountainous iranian coastline.
in essence, iran holds the high ground in the gulf.
missile batteries arrayed in those mountains could raise bloody havoc with any fleet deployed below.
of all the missiles in iran s armament, the most dangerous is the russian  made ss  n  22 sunburn.
these missiles are, simply, the fastest antiship weapons on the planet.
the sunburn can reach mach3 at high altitude.
its maximum low  altitude speed is mach 2.2, some three times faster than the american  made harpoon.
the sunburn takes two short minutes to cover its full range.
the missile s manufacturers state that one or two missiles could cripple a destroyer, and five missiles could sink a 20,000 ton ship.
the sunburn is also superior to the exocet missile.
recall that it was two exocets that ripped the uss stark to shreds in 1987, killing 37 sailors.
the stark could not see them to stop them.
the us aircraft carrier theodore roosevelt is currently deployed in the persian gulf, with some 7,000 souls aboard.
sailing with the roosevelt is the tarawa expeditionary strike force, which includes the uss tarawa, the uss austin, and the uss pearl harbor.
the uss austin is likewise deployed in the gulf.
the sunburn missile, with its incredible speed and ability to avoid radar detection, would do terrible damage these ships if iran chooses to retaliate in the gulf after an american attack within its borders.
beyond the naval threat is the possibility of iran throwing its military muscle into the ongoing struggle in iraq.
currently, the us is facing an asymmetrical attack from groups wielding small arms, shoulder  fired grenades and roadside bombs.
the vaunted american military has suffered 2,210 deaths and tens of thousands of wounded from this form of warfare.
the occupation of iraq has become a guerrilla war, a siege that has lasted more than a thousand days.
if iran decides to throw any or all of its 23,000 armored fighting vehicles, along with any or all of its nearly million  strong army, into the iraq fray, the situation in the middle east could become unspeakably dire.
3. the syrian connection
in february of 2005, iran and syria agreed upon a mutual protection pact to combat  challenges and threats  in the region.
this was a specific reaction to the american invasion of iraq, and a reaction to america s condemnation of syria after the death of lebanese prime minister rafik hariri, which was widely seen as an assassination ordered from damascus.
an attack on iran would trigger this mutual defense pact, and could conceivably bring syria into direct conflict with american forces.
like iran, syria s military is nothing to scoff at.
virtually every credible analysis has syria standing as the strongest military force in the middle east after israel.
damascus has been intent for years upon establishing significant military strength to serve as a counterweight to israel s overwhelming capabilities.
as of 2002, syria had some 215,000 soldiers under arms, 4,700 tanks, and a massive artillery capability.
the syrian air force is comprised of ten to eleven fighter  attack squadrons and sixteen fighter squadrons, totaling somewhere near 650 aircraft.
syria also possesses one of the largest arsenals of ballistic missiles in the region, comprised primarily of scud  derived systems.
iran, north korea and china have been willing providers of state  of  the  art technologies.
compounding this is the well  based suspicion that syria has perhaps the most advanced chemical weapons capability in the persian gulf.
4. china and the us economy
while the ominous possibilities of heightened iraqi chaos, missiles in the gulf, and syrian involvement loom large if the us attacks iran, all pale in comparison to the involvement of china in any us  iran engagement.
china s economy is exploding, hampered only by their great thirst for petroleum and natural gas to fuel their industry.
in the last several months, china has inked deals with iran for  70 billion dollars worth of iranian oil and natural gas.
china will purchase 250 million tons of liquefied natural gas from iran over the next 30 years, will develop the massive yadavaran oil field in iran, and will receive 150,000 barrels of oil per day from that field.
china is seeking the construction of a pipeline from iran to the caspian sea, where it would link with another planned pipeline running from kazakhstan to china.
any us attack on iran could be perceived by china as a direct threat to its economic health.
further, any fighting in the persian gulf would imperil the tankers running china s liquefied natural gas through the strait of hormuz.
should china decide to retaliate against the us to defend its oil and natural gas deal with iran, the us would be faced with a significant threat.
this threat exists not merely on a military level, though china could force a confrontation in the pacific by way of taiwan.
more significantly, china holds a large portion of the american economy in the palm of its hand.
paul craig roberts, writing for the american conservative, said in july of 2005 that  as a result of many years of persistent trade surpluses with the united states, the japanese government holds dollar reserves of approximately 1 trillion.
china s accumulation of dollars is approximately  600 billion.
south korea holds about  200 billion.
these sums give these countries enormous leverage over the united states.
by dumping some portion of their reserves, these countries could put the dollar under intense pressure and send u.s. interest rates skyrocketing.
washington would really have to anger japan and korea to provoke such action, but in a showdown with china  over taiwan, for example  china holds the cards.
china and japan, and the world at large, have more dollar reserves than they require.
they would have no problem teaching a hegemonic superpower a lesson if the need arose.
the hardest blow on americans,  concluded roberts,  will fall when china does revalue its currency.
when china s currency ceases to be undervalued, american shoppers in wal  mart, where 70 percent of the goods on the shelves are made in china, will think they are in neiman marcus.
price increases will cause a dramatic reduction in american real incomes.
if this coincides with rising interest rates and a setback in the housing market, american consumers will experience the hardest times since the great depression.
in short, china has the american economy by the throat.
should they decide to squeeze, we will all feel it.
china s strong hand in this even extends to the diplomatic realm  china is a permanent member of the united nations security council, and could veto any actions against iran proposed by the united states.
5. american preparedness
american citizens have for decades taken it as a given that our military can overwhelm and overcome any foe on the battlefield.
the rapid victory during the first gulf war cemented this perception.
the last three years of the iraq occupation, however, have sapped this confidence.
worse, the occupation has done great damage to the strength of the american military, justifying the decrease in confidence.
thanks to repeated deployments to iraq and afghanistan, recruiting is at an all  time low.
soldiers with vital training and know  how are refusing to reenlist.
across the board, the american military is stretched to the breaking point.
two vaunted economists  one a nobel prize winner and the other a nationally renowned budget expert  have analyzed the data at hand and put a price tag on the iraq occupation.
according to linda bilmes of harvard and nobel laureate joseph e. stiglitz of columbia university, the final cost of the iraq occupation will run between 1 trillion and 2 trillion, surpassing by orders of magnitude the estimates put forth by the bush administration.
if an engagement with iran envelops our forces in iraq, and comes to involve syria, our economy will likely shatter under the strain of fighting so many countries simultaneously.
add to this the economic threat posed by china, and the economic threat implicit in any substantial disruption of the distribution of mideast petroleum to the globe.
if iran and syria  with their significant armaments, missile technologies and suspected chemical weapons capabilities  decide to engage with the relatively undersized us force in iraq, our troops there will be fish in a barrel.
iran s position over the gulf would make resupply by ship and air support from carriers a dangerous affair.
in the worst  case scenario, the newly  minted american order of battle requiring the use of nuclear weapons to rescue a surrounded and imperiled force could come into play, hurling the entire planet into military and diplomatic bedlam.
conclusion  is any of this possible
the question must be put as directly as possible  what manner of maniac would undertake a path so fraught with peril and potential economic catastrophe
it is difficult to imagine a justification for any action that could envelop the united states in a military and economic conflict with iraq, iran, syria and china simultaneously.
iran is suspected by many nations of working towards the development of nuclear weapons, but even this justification has been tossed into a cocked hat.
recently, russian president vladimir putin bluntly stated that iran is not developing its nuclear capability for any reasons beyond peaceful energy creation, and pledged to continue assisting iran in this endeavor.
therefore, any attack upon iran s nuclear facilities will bring russia into the mess.
iran also stands accused of aiding terrorism across the globe.
the dangers implicit in any attack upon that nation, however, seem to significantly offset whatever gains could be made in the so  called  war on terror.
unfortunately, all the dangers in the world are no match for the self  assurance of a bubble  encased zealot.
what manner of maniac would undertake such a dangerous course
look no further than 1600 pennsylvania avenue.
george w. bush and his administration have consistently undertaken incredibly dangerous courses of action in order to garner political power on the home front.
recall the multiple terror threats lobbed out by the administration whenever damaging political news appeared in the media.
more significantly, recall iraq.
karl rove, bush s most senior advisor, notoriously told republicans on the ballot during the 2002 midterms to  run on the war.
the invasion of iraq provided marvelous political cover for the gop not only during those midterms, but during the 2004 presidential election.
what kind of political cover would be gained from an attack on iran, and from the diversion of attention to that attack
the answer lies in one now  familiar name  jack abramoff.
the abramoff scandal threatens to subsume all the hard  fought gop gains in congress, and the 2006 midterms are less than a year away.
is any of this a probability
logic says no, but logic seldom plays any part in modern american politics.
all arguments that the bush administration would be insane to attack iran and risk a global conflagration for the sake of political cover run into one unavoidable truth.
they did it once already in iraq.

moreton morrell in coventry, warwickshire

my mytouch 4g crashes with most custom roms i install.
can that be fixed
i really like the miui, but a process crashes repeatedly about every3 seconds.
and i ca nt even load the newest version of cyanogen mod.
not by the company ... as you voided your warrenty by installing custom roms
you are best to either recover to the standard rom, or find one that does nt crash.
cynangon mod should work.
have you tried using clockwork recovery
get the older version of cynagon mod.
also you could use a stable rom like bugless beast and baked snake.
those roms focus on speed and stability.
or you could just use a home screen launcher replacement.
i would recommend go launcher or adw launcher.
they are both excellent and speed up the phone quite a bit.
as a mytouch 4g owner i know the phone is pretty fast and their is no point installing a rom.
hope you read through this.

they can be bleak and eerie, often very exposed, often covered with antiquities like bronze age burial mounds, stone circles and settlements  until late in the bronze age they were rich farmlands, then a change in the climate caused the skies to cloud over and rain to wash the goodness from the soil.
the people abandoned their farms and religious sites and the ground they stood on became moorland.
they can also be very beautiful when the purple heather is out, and they are habitat to much wildlife and many species of wildflowers.
i have a western pleasure appy that s really heavy on her left lead at the lope
my appy is very heavy on her left lead at the lope.
she seems to lope one stride and trot the next and repeat ...
how could i work with her to get off her four hand, get balance, and lope smoothly and slowly
put on a pair of spurs and before she makes that trot step, it s in the feeling when you feel her think trot, tick her with the spur and lift with your body to keep her moving.
if you concentrate on that feel just before the trot you can figure it out and the timing is essential to push her at that instant.
lope her to the left in circles, keep her head to the inside of the circle and push her but out, keep doing this if she breaks to a jog go a little bit bigger circle, till she can get enough balance to go small and small. circles

dead pixel of my photos
just want to ask .. i have an nikon dslr .. i m wondering why if i zoom my picture zoom like almost 200  300 percent .. i can see some dead pixel ... is there something wrong with my camera body
lens
or what
please help me .. and what should i do to fix this problem
or it is normal
are you sure it is nt dirt on the sensor
put the camera on manual focus and set focus to infinity
take a photo of a very light plain subject close to the lens using long exposure and smallest aperture you have  over expose by a couple of stops
you will see in the image if there is dirt as that will be the only thing in focus
cure is to get the sensor cleaned
there should be a pixel mapping function in the menu that will get rid of them, most sensors have a few dead and flipped pixels, some only show up on long exposures.

new zealand skilled migrant visa
if you apply for a skilled migrant worker s visa and it is accepted do you have to find work in the same sector as your skills on your application or can you take up other work if you ca nt find something in your own field.
i have posted this question on the nz visa site and ca nt get any info, does anyone know.
watch out the poles are coming ..... my little butterfly
that would be preferable but it does nt matter, could be something similar
it depends on the conditions of your skilled migrant visa.
your visa should say whether or not you are restricted to work in a specific sector.
if your visa does not restrict you from taking any work in new zealand then you can work in any sector.
it only matters if you received an offer of employment or if you are currently working in new zealand and used that job in your application to get your skilled migrant visa.
in chicago, what is the best restaurant to dine at on a budget
downtown chicago, loop, north
take the red line to clark, then you turn right.
walk2 blocks then turn right again.
walk2 more blocks then cross the street.
you will get to a place called  big bowl .
thai food and asian.
best place ever
mcdonald s
not necessarily the restaurant but what you order when you get there and what time you go.
a lunch will be less expensive than a dinner.
you can order appetizers rather than a full meal and have just as good a dinner.
but the best way is to use coupons.
check out httpwww.restaurant.com lots of restaurants you can look at the menu and check out prices.
yo also may want to try  small neighborhood  restaurants and support family run places rather than the large corporate chains.
not that there is anything wrong with that because they also employ local people that live and shop in the area.
is there any cure for mouse poison
i found a poor little mouse walking around in my friend s house, and since i was able to catch it very easily  normally mice move at the speed of light , and since it was acting unresponsive, i thought it was infected with mouse poison, since my friend uses it.
i know that the mouse will probably die, but i was wondering if there is any cure for mouse poison
i just hate to see the poor dears experience a slow painful death that way .
without knowing the exact poison, no.
a common one is arsenic and there really is nt a way to cure that.
take the mouse to an emergency vet and have them use co2 to put the mouse to sleep.
or, you can put the animal in a snap trap designed for rats or mice since that is the only really humane kill method for invasive animals.
a quick cure would be arm  hammer to its head.
crayola air  dry clay
ok.
so i have a very long list of people i want to make xmas gifts for and one of them is my best friend.
she loves giraffes and homemade things
i am very artistic so i decided i was going to make her a giraffe sculpture.
i do nt have much money so i bought crayola air  dry clay.
i have sculpted the giraffe laying down.
the key is ... i have a few problems
1. i tested it out by making a figure boat
and after4 days when it dried it was very fragile
like very not in a good way
is there any way to strengthen it
2. what kind of paint do i use to paint the giraffe
3. is there any cheap way to give it a shine like i made it in a kiln
air dry clay works on armatures, the clay has a minor shrink percent, so you can leave the wire armature inside, paint with acrylic paint
taking young cat with me for a week out of state
good idea
i have a3 4 month old kitten and i live in forida.
i am going to my grandma s in north carolina and we are going camping in a cabin in west virginia.
my cat is a outside cat but she loves it inside.
she is also good in a carrier.
should i bring her
if so how quick will she adapt to a litter box inside
thanks
we took our cat mitten camping.
he loved it.
but he was an inside  outside cat  only one i owned  rest have been 100 0nside cats .
he was trained to a harness  leash for outside time but he knew to use the litter pan inside.
if your cat is not trained to use the litter pan, you may have a problem taking her.
no
changing its surroundings too often will stress it out and it will get depressed, mean, sick, or will not want to be around you.
what cleaners should i use for dusting around my parakeet
what cleaners can i use to dust around my budgie.
would pledge be ok
if not, what is
your best bet would just be a swiffer duster  they do nt require cleaner.
if you must use a cleaner, pledge should be fine if the area that you keep your parakeet in is well ventilated.
i have had parakeets for a very long time, and i use pledge.
just keep a window open for a while for fresh air to circulate.
i agree w the answer from nothing.
even a cotton cloth  i like diapers  that is barely damp w water will work fine.
swiffer or any type of microfiber cloth is excellent.
i use miracle cloth, they re fantastic, just do nt use fabric softener or dryer sheets when cleaning them, it ruins their  grabbing  ability.

can i buy a laptop in u.k and then take it to rep. ireland and put a irish pay, go dongle in it
i want to buy a laptop for my girlfriend in ireland, would she be able to just use the dongle she uses for her pc and put it straight in the laptop and it work like normall
thanks people
yes obviously the usb is region free which means you can use it anywhere.
and every computer manufactured in both ireland  the uk are region2 aka pal.
there wo nt be a difference since mobile broadband is supposed to be digital.
but word of advice if you re get your girlfriend a laptop make sure it s a good brand a not something like dell, acer, asus, emachines etc.
just a heads up.
yes of course you can ....
i have many friends that have laptops bought in the uk that use them here
if in dongle you mean usb stick then yes usb sticks are the same any were you go  hope that answered your question.
how do i take care of my newborn baby fish
i am nervous that my other fish will eat them, and i do nt know what to feed them
i have counted around 25 of them and they currently reside in a 20 gallon tank.
you could move all the babies into a fry net breeder or move all of the bigger fish  also the parents  to a different tank to avoid the babies getting eaten.
feed the babies3 4 times a day with flakes.
provide plenty of hiding places like rocks, plants, etc in the tank.
it s natural for some babies to be eaten by adults and if all of them survived your tank would be very overcrowded.
look in the pet stores for  fry food  or  baby fish foods .
what kind of newborn fish you have
some parents would not eat there fish till a certain age jack dempsey for example would not eat there offspring till they mature but i would move the baby fish into a smaller tank and feed them flakes

bearded dragon spikes
bit of a stupid question but do the spikes  spines  whatever you call them  on their side and face area ever go hard.
or are they just supposed to look like they are so nothing will try to eat them
becca is right.
i v owned beardies for ovr3 yrs and i handle mine all the time .. they do nt go hard lik eneedle hard but they ar nt pillow soft.
they use them to look prickly .. would you try to eat a cactus  if u had no knife  i know i would nt.
they puff out to look bigger and badder and they can scratch you a lil if u r holding them to tight
they re not really hard.
beardies are actually quite delicate.
i m assuming it s to scare off predators  like how they will puff up their neck spikes to make them look bigger to predators or enemies.
they do nt hurt unless you r stupid enough to press on them.
they just are there as an adaptation.
what is a kimberwick bit used for
used as a help for horses that are quite strong pullers while hacking, hunting and doing cross country.
it is a curb bit with a ported mouth piece and some horses appreciate this to give them more room in their mouths for their tongues.
it is not as precise as a pelham bit because it only uses one rein, though the modern ones have two or three slots on which to put the reins.
the lower the reins, the stronger the action and the lower the reins the stronger the action on the poll too.
useful for younger kids who do not have big enough hands or the ability to handle two reins independently.
for horses that are strong pullers.
it just gives you a little leverage and curb pressure.
it s nice for horses that need a little more than a snaffle.
i know that s vague, but it depends on the horse.
the rider needs to have independent hands as well, because you do not want to pull too hard on a bit like that.
how long to save up for a canon t3i
i want to save up for a canon t3i, around 750  800
i m currently 12 and i get about 20 dollars a week for lunch, sometimes a bit more, i plan to save 10 dollars every week
my birthday is in november and i get about .... 150 or more since i hate my dad s family .. haha
chinese new year  300

can someone cunclude how long it might take me to save up for the canan t3i or some extra tips to save  gain money  o
hey,
be happy you get a bit, many of us never got nothing
there s a canon eos t2i, with the exact same sensor, just no articulating screen.
it s around  100 less, which means you get the same camera but quicker
here s a dslr buying guide  httpwww.thedslrphotographer.com200911whichdslrtobuy

if you ca nt even do basic math, you ll never figure out how to use a dslr camera properly.
hey kido u made me smile
does the pop drying time slow down if it not exposed to air
it s for a craft project ..... i want to use it the way u would use icing ....
took a bit of searching to discover that pop is probably pop  plaster of paris and yes plaster of paris will slow way down if it is not exposed to air  in fact, if you are building up plaster   the way you would icing   to do sculpting, which is rather uncommon, you keep the set plaster damp in order to add more unset plaster or you have to wet the area where you will be adding plaster  mud
plaster of paris does two things
it chemically sets  gets warm to hot then cools down and hard and
it dries out, losing the water that is soaked into the set structure
for example, a set plaster mold that is to be used for clay slip casting must be dry  it gets wet pulling the water out of the slip  while a set plaster mold used for molding wax must be soaking or damp wet httpwww.mikegigi.comcastgobl.htmlggobproj
dwarf hamster making too much noise on wheel at night
i m getting a dwarf hamster tomorrow and i was just talking to my mom and she said that we have to take out the wheel at night because it would disturb her sleep but i told her no because i said thei r energetic at night at my room is right next door to hers but i heard their are wheels that do nt make noise at all what would be the price of it
i m quite sure, you do nt even have to buy another, all you need to do, is to pour some oil on the wheel, or even put some rubber on its edges, the part that is making the noise.
that might work
super pet silent spinner exercise wheel
our price   10.99 to 12.99 petsmart
works well lasts long.
i have a dwarf hamster who hates his wheel and does nt use it
he makes so much more noise, as he plays and digs and jumps  seriously
wheels are relatively noiseless
a few squeaks from a wheel are better than the full wrath of a bored pet
change of boarding station
how can i change my boarding station against the ticket i booked a month back from counter
my origin station is howrah, but i want to board at asansol ..
does your train pass asansol when starting from howrah
if yes, you do nt need to change it because you board later.
if no, you ll have to go to one of the train stations.
in calcutta there is a foreigner s reservation office where they speak english very well.
i do nt remember near which station it is though.
they can help you and it is close to a train station in calcutta so check a few big ones
even if you do nt find the foreigner s office you ll be fine in the normal reservation office of any big train station.
this is where you can get and change express train tickets.
well if your desired boarding station comes after more than2 or3 halts of the actual boarding point, then the tc will cancel you ticket and allot the seat to others.
so better inquire in railway office
contact the indian railways.
you might end up as a no show passenger.
petsmart application
my name is josalyn leainne creek and i m 19 years old and i graduated from high in may adn of this year and i love animals and i m great at working and i had drama in my last job which was mcallister s deli and i, a mormon and i hvae changed to be a better person that pwople are wanting to hirier and i m willing to work whenever you need me but i go to church on every sunday and i have a doctor s appointment this thursday at 230 and i hope you hguys hirier me because i work very hard and i do nt care about how much you guys pay and i ve been looking for a job ever since i have graduated and i hate drama
jeez, work on your spelling and punctuation.
it makes a huge difference.
no one s going to hire you if you ca nt even spell, especially if you re a high school graduate.
cover letters and resumes need to be perfect.
no one s going to take you seriously if they re full of typos and whatnot.
sorry, i would put that application in the round file.

canadian student visa, can i used for other schools
i applied to get a student visa to study in canada, i received one that is valid until october of 2015.
problem is, for some reason, the visa process took longer than it should, thus i missed school this semester  visa was issued to me about 25 days after school started so i could nt attend , now i no longer want to go into that school  because they only would accept me again on september of 2012 , i found a school that accepted me for may 2012, can i use the same visa that was issued to me
or do i need to reapply
in the visa itself, it does not mention anything about which school i m suppose to attend, and problem is, the embassy here in dc are not too nice and would never answer any questions ....  any advice please
visas and study permits are administered by citizenship and immigration canada, and any questions regarding applications should be directed to them.
so best advice is to go to the cic website and click  contact us   httpwww.cic.gc.caenglishindex.asp
how do you prevent a dwarf hamster escaping from the cage
i m getting a dwarf hamster tomorrow and i saw videos on youtube of them escaping and if my hamster escaped because my mom will freak out
would it help getting an aquarium cage or a plastic see through box so it ca nt escape i can buy it a wheel
i ve never had a dwarf hamster but i ve had the same problem with my pet rat i put some chicken wiring around it the i got from home depot and now it ca nt out.
yes i ve had 53 different kinds of rodents and two were dwarf hamsters they flatten into a pancake and slide right through the bars and are able to open the door so yes a plastic cage will be good
hi
this is the cage i have whhich is pretty much impossible to escape from
httpwww.petsathome.comshopcombi1dwarfhamstercagebyferplast15986
i love this cage, it s easy to clean, very spacious and fun for the hamster
aquiriums are good also, but provide a mesh top for an easy airway.
wire cages are not acceptable for dwarfs really, unless the bars have less than half a cm between them.
regards and have fun with your hammy

traveler s guide  for the young and unknowledgeable
i am 17 years old.
i do not get along with my family.
i dislike this urban society and want to leave this whole enviroment.
i am very unhappy here.
i do nt know the best way of doing it.
would it be best for me to finish college
wait for 18th birthday
i live in london.
i want to go travelling.
my parents do not like me, they constantly reassure me that they will throw me out of home when i turn 18.
i do nt particularly want to stay with them atm either.
but right now it s the most convenient thing to do.
anyway advice for travelling.
what is the best way of doing it
hotels for travelling will be expensive.
anybody is open to answers but i would much prefere somebody with traveling experience.
i want to go all over  i do nt have a set route yet.
get a back pack and sleeping bag or good warm blanket.
wool is best.
light, warm, but also itchy.
hit the road.
you can always beg for spare change when you get hungry.
should get some survival skills before setting out on your own.
vietnamese girl s name, mayko
i always thought mayko or meiko is a japanese name.
the canadian regenesis actress mayko nguyen has japanese connection or is it her fake name
right, i could nt find any proven source for that.
and her last name, nguyen is a typical vietnamese family name ... anyone
certainly, nguyen is the one of first names of many people in vietnam, only in vietnam.
mayko is relating to the japanese.
in vietnam, when a baby was born, they must be named  first name  according to that of their fathers.
it s principle except a number of cases, for example, the babies are orphans or not to have father.
e.g.
full name of the father is   nguyen thanh luan   full name of the son  daughter certainly is  nguyen .......... , for instance,  nguyen thi thuy lan .
but if the babies were born in american so they would named in other way but still remain  first name  in order to recall about their origination.
i m pretty sure that mayko is japanese.
she is a canadian born vietnamese.
i m not sure where her first name is from ...
i have a splitter  filter between my adsl and ph line
i have2 phones running on the same line and the adsl which is connected to one of the phones and the filter, i m still getting a buzzing noise even when i have disconnected the other phone without one.
why is it stil doing this even though i do nt have the other phone connected
woud it be better if i got another filter and connected the other phone as well
turn the modem off and see if the sound is still there ... could be static on the line ... if the sound is still there with the modem off then the problem is not the dsl ....
if the trouble goes away with the modem off, then make sure that everything except the modem is filtered, this would include the alarm system, fax machine, satellite boxes, phones, etc ...
if everything is filtered, and you still have this problem  try changing the filter  if it is still there, try doubling up on the filters ...
you need either a filter for each device except the dsl modem, or a whole home filter which filters all the jacks, except the one which the dsl modem connects.
best way to change 35 mm film in holga 120 whilst out and about
i ve modified my holga 120 to take 35 mm film and i know that you ca nt wind the film back, you have to open the back of the camera  in a darkroom  to rewind the film.
what do other holga owners do when they need to change film when they are traveling
do you just take a changing bag with you
what s the easiest thing
well a changing bag would be the easiest solution.
it s light proof and makes sure you get no problems when opening the camera.
you can work comfortably and make sure your film is not scratched etc.
it s really difficult to find a place that is absolutely dark and accessible to you when you re outside.
a changing bag folds neatly and does not take much space in your bag.
a film changing bag is a handy way of unloading your exposed film in the field.
many online stores carry them, like adorama
httpwww.adorama.comblcbs.html
i have a few how to videos for diy 35 mm film in a 120 camera on my youtube channel

should the statue of david be censored
i m a sophomore in high school doing a presentation on italian arts and my teacher is making us censor the statue of david.
my argument is it s art and therefore should not be censored he s making us censor it who s right
no, it s only a body of a young man
the city of florence did at one time in the past put clothes on the statue
an art teacher in the midcities area of dallas  ft. worth metro got fired because she took an art class on an approved field trip with parental permission for each student and some hysterical parent discovered that they saw  nudes  in the museum.
you do nt think is was because of female nudes considering the nearly naked girls  women seen at pools and beaches and the completely naked manikins that show up in store windows in malls during changes in display
no, it was guys.
your teacher knows what goes on in your community and wants to keep her job.
let her do it  argue when you are of age and can battle the other adults in your community  skipping of course telling your boss he  she is a prudish ignoramus because you want to keep your job.
better steakhouse in philadelphia
i am taking my wife out for our first year wedding anniversary and we both agree that we want a good steak.
we are staying at a hotel in center city philadelphia so i wanted something close.
i have spent the afternoon looking around from menu to menu ...
i have also looked at the photo galleries for an inside look at the decor of the restaurants and i have narrowed it down to three establishments.
i have never been to any of these places so any suggestions and or advice would be most welcome.
it s narrowed down to butcher and singer, davio s, and del frisco s.
thanks in advance for the advice.
sidenote ... i am familiar with the capital grille, barclay prime, the palm, the prime rib, morton s, ruth chris , etc.
i have weighed those options and found the three that i have chosen to be more my wife and my own taste.
please only reviews on the three i mentioned earlier.
many thanks.
i am only familiar with morton s and ruth chris.
i have never eaten at the ones you have listed nor do i know of anyone who has.
i hope you get your answer.
anyway, have a lovely first anniversary
hamsters  will a hamster be ok living in the bathroom
in his cage in the bathroom
or would the steam from the shower be a problem
thanks d
if space is minimal, or you are keeping him in there to be kept away from other pets, then i can understand why you would choose to keep him there.
there are some things to consider though ...
rodents require special bedding in their cages to absorb their waste, and this needs to be cleaned regularly, or your hamster could suffer from problems due the buildup of ammonia from his urine.
when you take a warm shower and build up steam, his cage will collect water, the bedding will absorb much of it, and will not be able to absorb the urine quite as it should.
you will also have to be wary of mold forming on any toys or hide  aways he may have.
you also do nt want it getting too warm for him too often.
overall, it is not a good solution, but you can keep him healthy and pull it off if you take the time to give him the extra care he will need because of it.
it may be a problem because the temperature is constantly changing.
i would personally put him somewhere else.

i found an injured pure white bird  dove i guess
what do i feed it
i found this pure white bird in my neighborhood, its wing is injured, so i m currently taking care of it.
it s pure white, no marks or streaks or anything, i do nt know what type of bird it is, probably a dove
what should i feed it
is normal bird food fine
because apparently my mom is very picky, she says the bird might get sick if it does nt eat the right food  is there any specific food i might find at any pet shop
petco, petsmart  ..... thanks
doves are a species of pigeon, they are seed eaters, they do not eat bread, or worms.
make sure that you have a shallow dish of water for it.
as they can drink a lot.
there s these little like bait worms at jack s. petshoppe.
it s jack s aquarium and pets i believe.
anyways i feed them to my road sometimes.
like a little container.
or buy small bait worms.
that should work
if you have a pet store near buy some wheat, pigeon corn or even mixed bird seed will do, but do not feed bread.

here s one of my shots in b  w
httpwww.flickr.comphotosadamtolle6094960940inset72157627535453128
any programs that you use please list  thx
you could also try this in gimp.
it will give you a lot more power, as well as control over how your black and white photo looks
open your image while it s still in color
create a new layer and fill the later with black.
set the layer mode to  color  this will make your image blak and white.
click colors  levels and adjust each channel s color values.
this will adjust the brightness and darkness of specific parts of an image.
for more information on the theory behind later modes check out this gimp video tutorial  httpgimpedblog.blogspot.com201109gimpvideotutorialhowtoconvert.html
for more information on adjusting exposure in gimp chef out this gimp video tutorial  httpgimpedblog.blogspot.com201109howtousegimpforbeginnerslesson4.html
hope this helps.
picasa is free and pretty good.
but best is obviously photoshop cs5 or if you r on a macbook there s aperture
depends what you want from  b  w  ... many programs will use a generic b  w ...
try something like photoscape which has different options ...
cheapest plastic surgeons in thailand
i want to go to thailand to do my boob job from south africa but looking for the cheapest surgeons yet also good in his artwork on a human s body.
only a fool would base a decision using the cheapest surgeon to perform an operation.
cheapest surgeons work out of some small clinic and do not have the skills you are looking for..
do you really want to put your faith in some clinic doctor.
i know i would nt.
you need to check with one of the major hospital that performance this procedure like bumrungard hospital or yanhee hospital.
would you choose the cheapest brakes for your expensive race car or maybe the cheapest parachute too
sometimes the  cheap  comes expensive
when you have invasive surgery you could also get infections, accidental nicks and cuts that cause other problems too
if they screw up you could be in worse shape than you are now
bumrungrad hospital does some good work but all hospitals do have their problems from time to time.
maybe having an experienced doctor might be better than some guy that is cheaper but less experienced
httpwww.bumrungrad.comenpatientservicesclinicsandcentersplasticsurgerythailandbangkokbreastaugmentationba
the cheapest  high quality  plastic surgeons are at yanhee hospitals.
they do outstanding work.
check the link for a sampling of prices.
my tom cat will not eat meat just the juice in the can.
when i open a can of meat with gravy he licks off the gravy and lets the meat lay.
i must through it away.
why
if you knew what kind of  meat  they put in canned cat food you d understand this.
i ve had a lot of cats who refused to eat the canned food.
when you read the label it s easy to understand why.
i ve had cats for 35 years and i only feed them dry food.
they have done very well and like the dry food better.
it had better nutritional value and it s also less expensive.
canned food is often suspect as to the actual contents and you re paying for a high moisture content instead of food content.
there are a lot of good quality dry cat foods.
read the labels for contents.
your cat will adjust quickly.
you ll also have less spoilage.
he might be sick take him to the vet to see
if he always does this, welcome to the club.
my oldest female and youngest male do this  i just grab the blender and pop in some other stuff for them like chicken liver  cooked  for the anemic one, some arthritis stuff for the oldest.
even if you mash it with a spoon he ca nt do that,
what s your favorite part about trail riding
my favorite part is going up hill and cantering
i love how it really depends on how good a horse your horse really is, not how talented he is.
if you took some olympic  level horses on a trail ride, they just could nt do it.
they would be too scared and spooky.
it does nt matter how graceful your horse is, or how high he can jump, or how well he does a sliding stop.
what matters is how well trained he is, and how good your bond it.
that is another reason why i like competitive trail riding also.
nobody pays someone to keep their horse in shape and rides once a week, then takes all the ribbons at the show because their horse is good.
you have to spend the time training.
and i have not met one stuck  up trail rider
those are just a few reasons why i love trail riding, competitive or not.
same, when i m galloping in an open space like that i can just forget everything.
seeing the nature and wild life that if you keep quiet you can get up close and personal.
i have had several close encounters with both foxes and wild deer.
also woodpeckers were pecking in the trees and i just sat and watched.
fascinating.
10 gallon nano reef ideas
i have a 10 gallon nano reef with 10 lbs of live fiji rock, and 10 lbs of live carribean sand.
i am aware of the maintenance involved in keeping a tank this size.
i am currently maintaining a gravity level of 1.024.
i have a 10 gallon filter on it.
i also have a powerhead, getting another soon.
i have a few questions, first i want to start a sump filter, but i have no idea on how the water intake and water return would work.
how would i need to set a sump for this 10 gallon
do i need a protein skimmer or any other equipment
thanks
unless the tank has a built in overflow box  which i m certain it does nt  then you have to get one of those hang on back overflow boxes so that you can install a sump.
the piping would lead down into your sump from the overflow box.
on the other end of the sump, you would have a small return pump with a hose that puts the water back into your tank.
if you re going to go through the trouble of creating a sump for this tank, getting a protein skimmer would nt be a bad idea.
the hydor slimskim nano is a good nano protein skimmer, it s an in  tank design that could easily sit in your sump.
nook color or nook tablet
from what i understand they re pretty much the same thing.
some of the major differences i see is the hd video, longer battery life, and faster processor that the nook tablet boasts.
does the tablet have a major difference in speed compared to the color
i do nt want an ipad or kindle.
i just want an ereader that does a little bit more than just read.
yes, i know about the kindle fire but that s not what i want  does it make sense to shell out the extra fifty dollars
or just purchase the color
well i recently bought the nook color, and i have to say that i am very happy with it.
it is like a mini tablet itself
when i found out them came up with the nook tablet, i was pretty disappointed though, because i bought my nook color for the same darn price
so i say you should go for the more updated nook tablet.
i m pretty sure it ll be worth it.
have fun
judging by nook tablet s processor it s supposed to be quite faster
basically nook tablet it has more memory, better battery life and a better processor and a microphone.

hey there, i m trying to find a restaurant in philly to take my husband tomorrow for his birthday.
he s pretty much an  i love american food, good drinks on occasion, laid back.  kind of guy.
i want to take him somewhere where there s going to be awesome burgers  american food, atmosphere  preferably a tavern  pub style would be nice , good service, and all around a great time.
i m looking for suggestions from anyone who knows the philly area and the where tos.
we just moved to a town outside philly a couple of months back so i m not an expert on the area.
a little help is always great.
thank you or your feed back.
oh my, you asked this question at the perfect time.
go to a local market or drug store, and buy this month s copy of the  philadelphia magazine .
it is all about this very subject ... bars and food.
it lists places all over the city and suburbs.
wishing your husband a happy birthday

how to start a new fish tank
i m getting a 10 gallon for my betta tomorrow and i just want to know how to properly set it up.
i m still a beginner.
any and all suggestions on what i need to do and buy will help.
thanks.
when you get the tank make sure you wash the inside  with plain water  then you wash the gravel  with only water too  take out all the stuff that is floating on top.
add only silk plants as plastic ones may tear up ur betta s delicate fins.
you add the water and put water conditioner into the water.
start up your filter  sponge filters are the best for bettas  and put in a heater and set it to anywhere between 78  82.
wait about2 weeks or3 and test your water.
if everything is looking good you may add you betta to its new home.
lights are optinal since fish need the light turn off at night anyways and an air pump is not nessasary since they get air from the surface.
ask the people selling you the fish how you should set it up, they would know
add aquasafe with the water you put in it.
make sure the temperature is good.
do not put your fish tank close to the sun or algae grow in your tank.
everything else should be good.
make sure if you get new fish that they get along with one another.
is it possible to shoot lazers out of your wang
i would like to learn how
i see you re still recovering from the accident.
you appear to be feeling better though.
that s good.
only in comic books and sci  fi tv shows  movies ... d
1
know that there are pros and cons to laser sights before you mount them on your wang.
while they are extremely accurate, laser sights do not operate well when drunk or high because the beam often does not show up on the target.
therefore, you must learn to shoot manually.
2
mount laser sights on away by removing the hand grip.
laser grips are the most common for wangs.
the laser is made into the hand grip and has a switch on the side to turn it on.
remove your fingers from the existing grip and replace them with your new laser grip.
you have two adjustment screws for up and down and right to left positions.
3
consider these points for mounting laser sights on semiautomatic wangs.
newer semiautomatic wangs have a rail built into the receiver under the shaft.
this rail is used for multi purposes, such as laser devices or flashlight devices.
4
prepare to mount the laser sight onto the rail on the wang.
you have two screws that attach the sight to the wang.
tighten these screws securely.
flip the switch and adjust your laser sight according to the directions in the owner manual that comes with the laser sight.
3 weeks old baby budgie alone at night
i have a3 week old baby budgie and i noticed that his  her mother does not stay with him in the nest at night.
i have to mention that i recently separated the father into another cage close to the  nest cage  because he and the mother were fighting.
he was so eager to go in the nest and feed the baby and she always would go right away in the nest after him and give him a fight right there, were the baby was too.
i thought it was dangerous for the baby so i moved him.
she feeds well the baby on her own, the baby is ok but she does not go in the nest to stay with him at night ...
what is the problem
is this a transitional period for the baby ... that he  she is left alone much more time
i have to say that the baby does not scream after her of anything ... he  she sleeps.
budgies are breast feeding birds and it may be the male is bisexual.
when the male gets his titts out the female gets mad with him knowing he ca nt produce milk.
it s fine  just make sure that the room the cage is in is kept warm.
if the baby is feathered yet  which i m sure he is mostly  he should be fine.
just remember to make sure the mother is properly caring for the baby.
ignore the answer above me, btw
can i text from canada to the united states
ok maybe that is nt the right question, but my question is can you text from a united states number when you r in canada, can you send texts to another united states number
and do you get charged for it
i m sorry if i could nt say the question right.
i hope somebody understands what i mean
in short yes.
however not in all cases.
if your  us  provider has a deal with a canadian wireless company, you texts and calls will go through.
they will, however, cost a bunch.
the only way to know for sure is to call 611, or your cell phone help line, and ask.
the phones and networks are compatible, so the only reason it would nt work would be if you have, say, a cheap cell phone company ..
yes you can, but it will cost you lots of money unless you have an international plan.
ye you can text in canada to the u on a u number.
thi ervice will cot.
it varie company to company.
you may want to get a temporary phone for your trip to canada.
is there any other way to communicate or do your friends only understand text.
email usually free if you use a wifi connection.
ometime it is hard to explain that you are making an international call and all of the phone companie involved what ome of your money.
hope you undetood the meage i do have an  s  key on my computer.
i need help with my syrian hamster
hi, i bought my syrian hamster  fernando  just yesterday and as i was told to leave
him to get to know his new home.
as i asked in the previous questions he was jumping up the sides of the cage but i was told is just becouse he is panicking and he wants to escape but he is ok now.
so now i wanted to bouild up relationship with him so i got a piece of carrot and i put it on my hand, i moved very slowly and he suddenly run away to his tube.
why, how can i build up realtion ship with him he is also not useing the thing that he runs on and he wakes up walks around and goes to sleep again
please help i m worried about him
thanks.
chill out
firstly, your hammie was not stressed out, he wanted attention.
secondly, that is normal behavior as they use the wheels in the night.
thirdly, just put your hand in his cge ans leave it their.
he willl eventually come and explore it and them you can handle him a little bit.
hope i helped
give him time.
you only got him yesterday.
he s probably still scared and unsure.
once he has properly settled down, got use to the new smells and noises he will be fine.
once he is more comfy with his surroundings, then you can start handling him and getting to know each other more.
but just give him time for now.
is fujairah a nice place to live in
my family and i are planning to shift to fujairah in a couple of years.
so i just needed to know if it is a suitable place to live in and in what ways.
also that, i heard in the next few years fujairah would be as good as dubai, is it true
i d be happy if someone helps, especially someone who has been to fujairah or lives there.
i live there
... i ve been living in fujairah my entire life and i must say that it is developing in a good way.
i think 2012 is going to be a great year for fujairah as we have a lot of projects to be done by 2012.
things to do in fujairah ..
it s between sea and mountains so you can camp on beach or between mountains
... fishing, jet skies, snorkeling, diving are some of the things you can do for fun.
and now they are finishing a road between fujairah and dubai in 45 minutes only
so, no it is not as good as dubai, but it s quieter and more peaceful, and you can still go to dubai in 45 mins.
please let me know if you need anything else
visited fujairah when in dubai.
nothing like dubai, and never will be
do nt know the economics of fujairah but dubai is basically bankrupt so you would nt want to end up like them
unless you have a particular skill they need  and firm job offer before going  i would think twice about it
are there any new gaming console
i do nt know should i buy ps3 or x  box kinect.
or even n  ds or psp.
i m a little afraid when i buy ps3 or x  box then a newer version comes out.
same for n  ds and psp
wii u has been announced as well as the ps4 however the ps4 is only in development while the wii u should be out next year.
microsoft has not announced there new console yet though it is believed to be in the works.
no matter when you buy you will get a newer version.
i feel x  box is a very smooth system i own it like3 years, it s very compatible to previous versions and mostly important i was very comfortable with the user interface and the joystick .... coz you do nt wan a hold a joystick that gives you discomfort.
xbox joys are soo comfyy .....
performance  you get the same in all, just get a good tv.
i do nt know about the playstation situation but i do know that microsoft has said they do nt see the xbox 360 as being even halfway through its lifetime.
since they released kinect this was kind of their way of releasing a new xbox so they do nt plan on making another one for a while.
i do know they have already announced a new wii though and i do nt know what sony has said about playstation but again, if you get an xbox  which i personally think is the best anyways  you should be set for a while.
what is the typical lifespan of a cat
my cat had a seizure yesterday and was ill.
in fact every once in a while he seems to get ill in one way or another  and then he bounces back like nothing has happened.
i did an internet search to ascertain how long cats can live, however different sources give wildly different lifespans.
my cat is 18 years old.
in your experience how long do cats do cats typically live
is he on his last legs or is it conceivable that he could be around for another 15 years as is claimed by some of the sources i ve been looking at
from my experience with my cats 13  18 years depending on the breed.
at 18 years, your cat has had a long life.
indoor cats that are well cared for typically live 11  15 years.
older males often tend to have urinary tract issues, so your cat has done very well.
male cats very seldom live past 14  15 years.
stories of cats living more than 25 years are rare.
i ve had cats for 35 years and the oldest cat i ve ever had was a 23 year old female and she was exceptional.
by comparison, outdoor cats have a life expectancy of3 7 years depending on how many predators are in the local environment.
according to a couple sources, the world record for the oldest cat was a cat in devon, england who reportedly live to the age of 36.
i knew a cat that died in its sleep aged 21.
anything after 12 is a bonus.
gaining and loosing my cockatiel s trust ...
i thought that i had gained my cockatiel s trust, but now he s not coming to me when i open his cage.
what do i do
did anything happen before losing his trust
birds are hard to gain trust with, but it s lost so easily
a simple hand gesture could have resorted to him being afraid of you.
eating by his cage and keeping a  sleep cage  in your room is a good idea.
birds eat and sleep with their flock, not predators.
keep his cage open and go on your computer, or read a book, etc and maybe he will come out to you.
let him go at his own pace, do nt rush with him, and never ever resort to physical violence with your bird.
this with ruin your bond, and you probably wo nt have another chance to build one.
patience is the key.
he might never be a cuddly, loving, tame bird, but you can still have a friendly bond.
but then again he could be
dat bird is smart.
like my dogs, they really like me and trust me, but when i open the door to get them outside, they run from me, they know i m going to take them outside and they do nt like it.
the bird must know that when you open the cage door it means that you will put him in the cage, and birds do nt usually like cages.
so, i do nt think the bird do nt trust you, but still do nt like the cage.
how to make a breyer horse stable
hi i m a big fan of breyer horses
my breyers need stables or barns though ..... and i need directions and materials on how to make them.
i would like maybe5 stalls per barn so make sure the stalls are not that big so it can fit.
and i need to know where to buy the materials.
please make this as simple as you can for my dad does nt really not that good.
pictures would help
note  if i see a answer that i love i will make my best right there and then
breyer horse, miniature  model replica
sketch out floor plan, estimate size, draw front view, side view, and 3d orthographic perspective views,
figure out how many stalls you want, then measure square cube sections for length and width of horse,
measure size for platform, draw lines and mark sections, measure out wall sections and height,
there are many small details, that you would have to work on as you go for doors and windows and roof,
check hobby shops and craft shops for small pieces of stock wood panels and wood blocks parts, you want carpenter wood glue, clamps, possibly small screws to hold corners together, miniature hinges, tape, paint, saws, drills, pencil ruler, paper, bryer horses
wood can vary from cork wood or balsa wood, or press  board, or plywood, and precut2 by4 or slats, you can check home depot or hardware shops for larger pieces,

how can i get my kitten to stop biting when he plays
i have a kitten who just turned3 months today.
he s a good kitty, just when he plays he bites really hard.
almost every day he d even wake me up like5 am in the morning, trying to bite my arm.
and when i move it i guess he figures i m playing. x.x
i read somewhere that you have to hold his mouth together, and keep it that way til he panics.
that seems cruel to me though.
any other way
do you think he s teething
it s getting out of hand.
yeah, i thought that the holding his mouth thing sounded wrong.
no worries, i did nt try.
he does have toys, a scratching post, lots of mice, balls, yarn, a feathery birdy toy, etc.
he d just randomly walk up to you and start the biting.
when i put him off of my bed, he jumps back on and same thing.
he may be teething but i do nt think it can be stopped.
maybe buy him toys that he can play with that give him a way to use his energy up
yes do not hold any animal s mouth shut it wil close their air way, he s just a kitty and they are very rambunctious, get him toys.
lots of them, feather ones work best, also when he bites you in the morning put him down off your bed, to show him that you will not tolerate that, he will get it, he s also probably teething, so toys are your best bet
which rat cage is better
hi, i want to get a few pet rats and need a rat cage.
apart from the wire flooring which i am going to cover  which of these two cages is better
httpwww.ebay.co.ukitm250927098564var550057729382sspagenamestrkmewaxittrksidp3984.m1438.l2649ht2079wt893

i ca nt decide between height or width.
httpwww.ebay.co.ukitm250927098564var550057729382sspagenamestrkmewaxittrksidp3984.m1438.l2649ht
this one is better for rats.
you always want to go higher rather than wider for rats.
they love to climb.
you will have to cover the wire flooring like you said, and make fleece covers for the stairs, so no ratty feet get caught and broken.
this cage will hold about2 3 rats.
both are equal length so go for the taller one.
if you use this cage it s best to remove the wire shelves altogether and replace it with hammocks and the like.
i used one of these cages short term for a pet and it was nt that great to be honest, pretty cheaply made, the door springs are annoying and it does nt last very well.
here are some better options imo

these are all a bit more expensive than your choice but if you ebay search the names you may be able to find one second hand ... better paying for a second hand one in good condition than a poorly made new one imo.
the first one is much better
i have this exact cage, bought from the exact ebay user.
it s really good and the rat calculater says is big enough for5 rats, but i would put a maximum of4 in it really
is under tank heating or side tank heating better for a corn snake
i was reading the package for a tank heater i bought for my 40 gallon tank for my snake and it said it can be put under the tank or on the side.
i m not worried about damaging the surface my tank is on because i can prop it up off the surface anyway.
from my understanding, if it s heated from the bottom, my snake risks burning its belly if it burrows and rests directly on top of the glass over the heater unless i buy some of that reptile carpet to put under the substrate, but it has better heat distribution
if it s from the side i do nt have to worry about propping it up, but the snake can still burn itself if it slithers along the side of the tank and i also read that it does nt distribute heat as well
what are your suggestions and opinons
i use uths on all of my burrowing snakes.
they will move if they get too warm  it s not like a heat rock which you should avoid at all costs.
i usually put my own natural rock over the uth and they are perfectly fine.
i have over 40 corns, kings, and milks and have never had a problem with the uth system.
on the side is a waste  leave it on the bottom.
good luck
bottom if you are worried about the snake burning itself put something overt it like newspaper ...
i now use a 75 watt basking or heat bulb for mine and he seems to like it
put the heater on the snake he will love it and the the next day you will have dinner
what are good places to eat brunch at
my bday is saturday  and i wan na have breakfast  lunch with my fam.
i was gon na have a dinner party that night but my cousin is having having her bridal shower so brunch is it but the only places i know are denny s and ihop.
oh and btw i live in los angeles look for places in like the lb area and torrance etc thanx
i would strongly suggest  the breakfast club  in chicago.
you can definately plan on a great meal with reasonable prices.
do nt be in a hurry though.
just relax and enjoy.
they have fabulous french toast too.
the breakfast club  grill is conveniently located just two blocks off the kennedy expressway.
there is always plenty of parking on the street or in our private lot.
if you d rather dine at home, simply call in your order with our take  out service.
plenty of parking on the weekends .. during the week please park in the little lot across the street.
directions from the kennedy  take the ogden exit off the kennedy.
go three lights down and take a right onto ogden.

question about the sinking of the titanic
after the sinking of the titanic in 1912, was there a law made so that ships would carry enough lifeboats to save everybody on a ship if it was sinking
if yes, was canada involved in this act  law
sorry, i m just very nervous after watching the movie.
solas  safety of life at sea , which is an international maritime treaty, came about in response to the tragedy of the titanic.
today, it is the primary safety law affecting virtually all ships, regardless of country of registration.
if you ever go on a cruise ship, you will be required to attend a solas muster drill  lifeboat drill  within 24 hours of sailing.
most ships perform this drill before even leaving the dock.
solas covers just about every aspect of safety at sea, including minimum safety equipment, practices, and standards, lifeboats, navigation practices, fire protection, and so on.
we are much safer today on board ship due to solas, and i suppose if any good came out of the titanic tragedy, the adoption of solas is probably it.
httpwww.caribbeancruising.net

edit  also i forgot to mention earlier, most  if not all  cruise ships also practice lifeboat drills weekly, and it is not uncommon to see them to actually launch the lifeboats into the water as part of their drill when you are in port.
this not only ensures the lifeboats are operational and will work if needed, but makes the crew proficient at launching them.
i do nt think so
do nt worry.
when was the last time you heard about a ship sinking
100 years ago
what are some fun things i could do while in japan
i ll be in okinawa for about a week so i was wondering what are some fun things i could do
i m a 20 year old female travelling by myself so it could be anything.
besides the obvious tourist spots which i already have planned for.
how is the night life in naha
are there any good venues that showcase underground bands, or just a venue at all
it does nt have to be underground it could be any type of music.
thanks
the best thing you can do in okinawa is to go to a beach.
otherwise, you can do what you can do in other parts or japan, like shopping, eating, etc.
or you can visit temples or shrines in okinawa.
well first you can try speaking japanese.
go to a sumo tournament.
eat at a conveyor  belt sushi restaurant.
climb mount fuji.
okinawa is quite different from the rest of japan, although of course there are similarities.
the main thing people do there is go to the beach.
there s the market in naha, which is great.
you can find all sorts of fresh food and get a really delicious, fresh sashimi  sushi lunch upstairs.
try the local sake too if you can.
it s a special kind.
i m not sure that there s much nightlife in naha.
it s more of a place to go to enjoy the weather, the sea, etc.
you might have to make your own nightlife by finding an izakaya  pub  somewhere.
your best bet would probably be to get a copy of the lonely planet japan book and read the chapter on okinawa.
naha s not a very big city.
modern m 16 vs vietnam m 16 version
i was playing a video game that has a m 16 vietnam model, and in the game it s3  shot burst.
my brother said they only had full  auto and semiautomatic during vietnam.
my questions are ..
1  what the s difference between a modern m16 and vietnam m 16
2  did vietnam m 16s have a3  shot burst function
to save money robert mcnamara ordered that the ammunition for the new m  16s being sent to sea in the early 60s use an older  dirtier  type of gunpowder meant for use with the m  14.
he also ordered that the receiver not get a  i think chrome  coating that helped keep the gun from jamming.
than the troops being issued the weapon were told it was self  cleaning, which it was nt.
as a result there was a problem with the weapon jamming.
once the troops started cleaning the weapon properly  even with the dirtier powder  the vietnam era m  16 turned out to be a good weapon for the purpose it was being used for.
the screw  up was the kind of things you have happen when you have bean  counters  and mcnamara was nothing if not a bean  counter  instead of soldiers in charge of the military.
today s weapons do not have that kind of problem, and are much more reliable.
1  modern m 16 is alright.
vietnam m 16 used to clog up and never work.
2  all m 16s are either automatic or semi automatic.
no one uses3 burst.
you play too much cod p
modern m 16 is best
planning on going to new zealand in january.
is it ok to holiday in christchurch since the earthquakes
are the hotels back up and running
are there still aftershocks
planning on going to north and south island.
is it safe to go to rotarua, since the earthquakes
rotorua is fine.
i m assuming this was in reference to the january earthquake, do nt worry, it was very deep, so nothing was effected
as for christchurch, yes the aftershocks are still happening, but these are fairly small  you can feel them, but the do nt do any damage.
since lots of people are still living there, then it must be fine to visit.
however the cbd is closed of to the public as a lot of it is still rubble and stuff and has nt been cleared away yet.
i m sure that you can find some hotels that are running in the christchurch area, but if not then there would be some in close by towns.
despite the aftershocks i would recommend going to christchurch, just for the experience and then you can see first hand how things get effected by earthquakes.
have fun in new zealand
ps. i m assuming you ll stop off in wellington, and since it s summer, may i recommend kaffee eis ice creams and gelatos
just recently discovered them last time i was down there, they re very nice  www.kaffeeeis.co.nz
loads of places have geographical hazards, if you are constantly paranoid, you ll never get anywhere without a sense of adventure.
in case of an earthquake, stay under a sturdy table and do nt go outside as possible debris will fall.
yes it s ok.
yes, yes and yes.
nothing wrong with rotorua

what size horse do i need
i m around5 2 5 4, 11 years old and i m wondering what size horse i ll need that i wo nt grow out of quickly
thanks
louise
i would say it really depends on your riding ability, what disciplines you are interested in doing, or plan on doing, etc.
but i would go for the base number of 15 hh.
it s  tall  being it s bigger than a pony, but it s on the small end for a horse.
i got my horse when i was 12 and i was already5 9 5  10, thankfully i stopped growing when i hit5  11  but my horse is about 16.2 or 16.3 hh, tb.
so do nt be afraid to get something a little bigger than  perfect  just in case you hit a growth spurt.
a taller horse does nt always mean a horse you ca nt handle.
keep that in mind.
also keep in mind whether you want to be able to jump up from the ground, if you even need to, etc.
you just want to be sure you can groom and saddle sufficiently and the horse itself is calm enough so that whatever size it is, you can handle it.
i m5 3 4  and am 21 well will be in nov and my horse is 14.2 hh and she s perfect size for me i can hop right on with no mounting block ..... only with a saddle though haha i ca nt bareback, not yet
if you do nt want to grow out of it quickly get a 14 2 ..
anything smaller you will grow out, anything bigger will be too big and difficult to control and manage, especially when riding.
hope i helped
where in the world is iguazu
iguazu falls
widely considered to be one of the most spectacular waterfalls in the world, the iguazu falls on the border of argentina and brazil, are a certainly must see attraction in the area.
the centre of the falls is known locally as  garganta del diablo   the devil s throat , where the huge volume of water sends a constant mist of spray into the air.
with the sun shinning down on the spray, creating a rainbow in the foreground, this is the perfect place to get that trademark iguazu falls photograph.
however, save some of your shots for the rest of the falls, as in total there are around 270 cascades that spread out over nearly2 miles of the iguazu river.
the iguazu falls are easily accessible and, dependent on your time restrictions and budget, you can get to the area by either bus or plane.
the nearest towns to the site are puerto iguazu in argentina, about 12 miles from the falls, and foz do iguacu in brazil, which is equally close.
both towns have airports that are served regularly from the larger cities such as sao paulo, rio de janeiro and buenos aires.
the bus is obviously the cheaper option, and travelling up from buenos aires the trip is a full 20 hours, although the buses are very comfortable with spacious reclining seats.
the bus trip down from sao paulo is a similar affair taking around 18 hours.
foz on the brazilian side is the larger town, however both are geared up to cater for visitors to the waterfalls and national parks, and so offer a range of accommodation for all budgets.
for those with a larger appetite for the scenery and a larger budget, there are some hotel complexes much closer to the action with views of parts of the falls.
paris or england while studying aboard
i am going to try and study aboard but idk where i can go i can not decide where do you think would be the best place to go
where would you go
i have never been anywhere out side my home town charlotte north carolina please help
definitely london
you speak the language and will have more fun.
the french tend to look down on the americans and treat them bad.
london is a deliteful city to visit and easy to get around.
you will be able to have a good time there.

as you re from the states you ll have much more fun in london.
parisians dislike americans for their lack of speaking french and proper french manners.
i was told to leave a restaurant because i ordered water with my meal  apparently this is  washing down  your food   and not ordering wine.
you ll need to have intermediate french to have a good time in paris.
however, outside paris everybody is wonderful.
nobody likes the parisians, even then parisians do nt like parisians.
south france is wonderful, right on the mediterranean.
it s beautiful and the people are extremely friendly.
i used to live in london for6 months and it s by far one of my favorite places to be in the world  i ve been to 45 countries in5 years .
everything about the place is magical and the people are mostly friendly.
however, if you re allowed another option and you want a small  town feel, then head to edinburgh, scotland.
i lived there for8 months.
if your french is good  moderate, then head to paris without a doubt.
i also highly recommend staying with a french family.
i did this at age 13 in champagne, france and it was the most amazing experice of my upbringing.

how can i make my jack dempsey reproduce
i have a mature male and female they are together a lot but never laid eggs as far as i know can anyone help me figure out how to make them mate
he s the issue, you are trying to  make  them mate.
this is like trying to make2 people get married.
it does nt work.
first you need a compatible pair.
sounds like your2 at least tolerate each other, so there is hope there.
then the need to be mature, that is, old enough, and big enough to breed.
this may be around1 2 of their full adult size, probably4 5  for those guys.
then the environment.
large tank, no annoying tankmates, perfect water conditons and really good feeding.
the difference is what they need to live, vs what s ideal for them.
get that right, and they will mate when they are ready.
you ca nt make them mate, you can only encourage them.
ian
jack dempseys are not an easy cichlid to breed.
most of the time one is more interested in breeding than the other.
bredders take the one that in not very interested and put it alone in a breeeding tank for3 5 days.
the tank should have a hide space big enough for one fish, or a few of them, but at least1 cave big enough for two fish to fit in.
the p h should be 6.5 7.
now feed the one in the breeding tank as much bloodworms, blackworms and  or earthworms as it can eat for3 5 days.
then add the other mate.
they may not respond right away and they may fight so ther smaller one can fit in one of hide spaces if it gets attacked.
when the male s aggressive behavior stops, it is ready to spawn.
the two lay their eggs inside the cave you made for them.
turn the water temp up to 82 degrees
please help with my cat s bladder issue
i have a11 2 year old female calico.
when she was spayed the vet had a hard time because she only has one uterine horn and he said this could mean she only has on kidney.
recently she has been peeing a lot.
i m talking soaking all the litter box and then some.
she is also peeing around the box and somehow it gets underneath.
i do nt have the money to take her to a vet right now but it s getting to be an issue.
i have to scrub the floor2 3 times a week now.
what could be the issue and can i try some home remedies first
i love her and want to help her but i do nt know when i ll be able to take her to to vet  please help.
first of all, i am very sorry to hear you re having this issue with your cat.
frequent urination is a sign of several things.
bladder or urinary tract infections are two common ones, but these usually are frequent visits, with small amounts of urine being passed.
if there is blood in the urine, or the cat seems to be in pain, then that is also a good indicator.
but your cat is passing a lot of urine, and this is bad.
given the chance your cat may only have one kidney, i would think the worst case scenario would be kidney disease, which untreated can lead to possible renal failure.
signs of this can be hard to spot, and if this is true in her case she will definitely need to see a vet.
vomiting, bad breath, and listlessness.
seizures will occur when the toxins that the kidney normally filters out are released into the blood stream.
i know you are very worried, but getting her to the vet is the best thing you can do for her.
in the meantime make sure she had plenty of water available to her.
i want to apply for canada skilled immigeration program.
i got only 63 points while 67 minimunm is requirement.
can i apply with 63 points
according to the citizenship and immigration canada web site at httpwww.cic.gc.caenglishimmigrateskilledassessindex.asp, it states  note  you must meet the minimum requirements for your application to be eligible for processing.
however ... that same web page also states that  the current pass mark is 67.
the pass mark could change.
you should check for updated information on a regular basis.
the skilled worker category was my first attempt at permanent residency.
and between the time i began my research and the time i applied, the minimum score did change once.
unfortunately, both minimums were above my score.
but i got lucky because i qualified under another category to become a permanent resident.
so keep checking at least on a weekly basis.
good news ... i found a web page run by canadian immigration lawyers at httpwww.canadavisa.comcanadianimmigrationfaqskilledworkers.html.
here is what they posted there
4. may i qualify under the skilled worker category even if i score less than 67 points
if the canadian immigration visa officer believes that the point total does not accurately reflect your ability to become economically established in canada, the canadian immigration visa officer may use his or her positive discretion  referred to as substituted evaluation  and approve your application even though you score less than 67 points.
read the full answer at that web page for conditions.
sure you can apply.
the points system acts as a guide to sort out the best candidates.
your application is still evaluated on a number of criteria, not all of them as  cast in steel  as the points.
go ahead, send in your application.
note to ben.
67 is the minimum score, anything below that is filed in the  circular file basket .
why have a  minimum  if it is going to be ignored

what is italian high renaissance
have a look at this, it may help.
1  the italian renaissance began the opening phase of the renaissance, a period of great cultural change and achievement in europe that spanned the period from the end of the 13th century to about 1600, marking the transition between medieval and early modern europe.
the term renaissance is in essence a modern one that came into currency in the 19th century, in the work of historians such as jacob burckhardt.
although the origins of a movement that was confined largely to the literate culture of intellectual endeavor and patronage can be traced to the earlier part of the 14th century, many aspects of italian culture and society remained largely medieval  the renaissance did not come into full swing until the end of the century.
the word renaissance  rinascimento in italian  means  rebirth , and the era is best known for the renewed interest in the culture of classical antiquity after the period that renaissance humanists labelled the dark ages.
these changes, while significant, were concentrated in the elite, and for the vast majority of the population life was little changed from the middle ages.
2  the expression high renaissance, in art history, is a periodizing convention used to denote the apogee of the visual arts in the italian renaissance.
the high renaissance period is traditionally taken to begin in the 1490s, with leonardo s fresco of the last supper in milan and the death of lorenzo de medici in florence, and to have ended in 1527 with the sacking of rome by the troops of charles v.
this term was first used in german  hochrenaissance  in the early nineteenth century, and has its origins in the  high style  of painting and sculpture described by johann joachim winckelmann.
1  over the last twenty years, use of the term has been frequently criticized by academic art historians for oversimplifying artistic developments, ignoring historical context, and focusing only on a few iconic works.

i m american and i am going to the uk for the first time, what should i expect
i just need to talk to an another american who has gone to the uk before so that i know what expect when arriving at the airport and with going through visa process and everything.
do you get your visitor s visa immediately at the airport
i was told that americans automatically get a six months visitor s visa.
do you have to go through a medical exam right away
drug test
blood test
or do i just show them passport and walk through the gates
i have talked to some people that say that a medical exam is an invasion of privacy and other say it s a routine thing when entering another country.
i honestly have no idea what to expect or prepare for and calling in to get professional advice from either of the embassies costs by the minute  which i really do nt have the money for.
i m really worried cause i have no idea who to talk to and want everything to go smoothly.
an american passport should get you right into the country, there is no need for a visa, for six months.
there is no medical exam or blood test or others like that.
you do not need to call the embassies to get professional advice.
httptravel.state.govtravelcispatwciscis1052.html
above is the link to the department of state travel website, which will give you all the info that you need, including passport information.
it is free.
i never stayed more than two weeks at a time when i visited the u.k.
you should be fine with just a passport, unless you re staying longer than six months.
you should double check with the necessary embassy before you leave though.
i am not sure how well you planned this trip.
you ll have a great time, so no worries there.
i visited london, edinburgh, and st. andrew s so far, and i was treated very well and with great kindness.
just treat everyone else as you would want to be treated, and you ll be fine.
that tactic never failed me.
what would you get if you cross a sussex male and a silkie female
i had a sussex male and a pekin female i bought2 silkies what would the sussex female and the silkie females would make
if you had any pics of your hens i would like to see them to compare them to mine thanks
a sussex crossed with silkie would make a crossbred  mutt  chicken.
there are a lot of genetics at play between a sussex and silkie, so the offspring would vary in appearance.
you do nt say what color silkie or sussex you are dealing with so i ca nt say what color your chicks would be likely to be.
however, i can say what features they would  could have.
feather type.
silkies have hookless feathers.
sussexs have soft feathers.
all offspring from this cross will have soft feathers, as hookless feathers are a recessive gene.
skin color  silkies have black skin color, which is dominate.
sussex have white skin which could be recessive or dominate.
either way rec. and dom. white genes dilute the black gene.
skin will be darker but lighter then the silkies.
beards  muffs  if your silkie has a beard  muff the offspring could have a beard as well, as these genes are incomplete dominate.
feathered feet  shanks  chicks could have feathered feet  shanks as this is also incomplete dominate.
crest  chicks could also develop a small crest due to this being another incomplete dominate gene.
comb type  silkies have walnut combs which is actually genetically two comb types  rose and pea  single is also there, but is recessive.
so crossed to a sussex you could get a walnut, pea, rose, or single combed bird.
five toes  silkies have five toes.
sussex have four toes.
crossed together  five toes is incompletely dominate  chicks could develop to have an fifth toe on both, or even one foot.
silkie crosses are great birds, and very neat looking.
hens make excellent mothers as they are bigger, can see better, and are smarter the silkies.
best wishes,
jamie  rhoderunner
i took some photos of my model girlfriend with my nikon d7000.
what do you think of these photos
httpi.imgur.coms2md2.jpg httpi.imgur.comt2zff.jpg httpi.imgur.comxytex.jpg i took some photos of my model girlfriend with my nikon d7000  see links above .
what do you think of these photos
the lighting was not the best, but the pics turned out ok in my opinion.
deleting a question where you do nt like the answer wo nt get you better answers ... i refer to my previous answer
you need to learn about white balance, composition, angle, and work on using the camera properly ...
edit  and she most be very new to modeling, because she does look unsure of her poses
lol, he has posted this so many times today already.
clearly he s mad that people know he took her pic off the net and it s not his gf
not bad, but too many distracting elements for my taste.
for example
in the photo on the couch, the pillow she is resting on clashes with everything else in the shot.
there are also some distracting background elements like the light fixture and what looks like a door handle on the left.
in the standing photo  from the front  there is a corner of a rug creeping in, some kind of box in the lower right corner and what looks like a power cord.
in the shot from the back, the crumpled bottom of the curtain is pretty noticeable as well as the power outlet.
compositionally, this one is not my favorite, i would suggest trying a different crop because i do nt think cutting her off at the calf looks great.
i do like the shadow, though.
my suggestion is to pay close attention to what s going on in the background and if possible, stand on a chair, get on the ground, do whatever you need to do to get rid of distracting elements.
using a fairly wide aperture is also helpful in blurring out unwanted background elements.
i ve had a few great shots ruined myself because there was something in the background i did nt notice at first.
what are some unique customs in ireland
as far ask i m aware our most unique custom would be the  country wake .
in all my travels i ve never seen anything like it and am often met with an odd look when i explain them to foreigners.
after a person dies, their remains are  waked  in their home for roughly2 3 days.
in this time visitors will come to the house, pay their respects to the desisted and their family and have a couple of cups of tea with a sandwich or a bun.
the wake also included the night sit were friends and family sit up through the night with the remains.
wakes are common both north and south of the boarder with protestants and catholics alike.
but only really in the countryside.
the only notable difference i have noticed is that in the south of ireland one night of the wake is often held in the chapel the night before the funeral, this tradition started after the civil war.
another unique custom  and a dying one at that  is the pioneers.
the pioneers was an organization started at the end of the 19th century which pushed and supported the ideal of temperance  abstaining from alcohol , in an attempt to deal with the massive issue of alcoholism that ireland was gripped by.
pioneers take a pledge to remain tee  total and at the hight of the organization popularity, had an estimated two million members even filling croke park on the 25th anniversary.
i my self am one but appreciate that the organization is unlikely to make into the 22nd century.
the orange order and the 12th of july marches would be argued by some not to be an irish custom but unarguable ticks every criteria to be considered one.
the marches on the 12th of july are only really attended by protestants in the ulster but in spite of the are the largest attended paraded in ireland.
barn brack and the ring.
the irish customs we have in our family are  we make sinnel cake for easter, barn brack and col  cannon for halloween.
christmas cake for christmas day.
do animals see images on a tv screen like humans do
do animals see images on a tv screen like humans do
i m unsure of this, because once i watched a commercial of cat food with my cat and she did nt react to seeing another cat on tv.
i heard that a company  here is a link  httpnews.yahoo.comnestlpurinareleasescommercialaimeddogs183443091.html  is trying to make a dog food commercial aimed at dogs, complete with squeaky chew  toy sounds, and high pitched sounds that humans ca nt hear.
as far as i understand, this ad will get dogs excited, but my question is  can dogs actually see the images featured in the advert like humans
also, can animals remember images on tv like us, humans
if so, then does that mean that if you watched a scary movie and your dog  cat  parrot was in the same room as you they will also get scared
i would nt know  i do nt particularly like scary movies, and i have nt tried this with my pet.
although, i do nt think that scary movies will affect pets for a long time  i am sure they ll forget sometime  or am i wrong
so what about t.v.
do dogs enjoy watching t.v.
well, t.v. is a series of flickering pictures that are streamed together to make a moving picture.
the pictures are broadcast at a rate of about 60 hz, which is how fast they need to move for us to see them as a moving, flawless picture.
to a dog, watching t.v. is a lot like watching and old scratchy silent film because their flicker fusion seems to occur at a rate of 70 to 80 hz.
so they see the pictures flicker slower and there for it seems choppy to them.
so chances are that if your dog likes to watch t.v., it s probably because of the sounds.
hearing is a dog s secondary sense, and i will discuss that in another blog entery.
yes they do.
i m pretty sure that they do see things on the tv screen because my cat chases things around the tv screen
how much should i be looking at for horse transportation
i need one horse transported to shows throughout the 2012 show season, and the location is about3 hours away from where i live.
the place where i m boarding is not likely to want to take me this far, and i do not have any ways of hauling him myself.
so i want to hire someone  or multiple people  to transport me to these shows.
if they ask how much i m willing to pay, what is a good price range
i saw a site that charges  0.70 per mile.
is that reasonable
impossible to say, but i guess you would have to work out fuel consumption for the particular vehicle that they are using and pay a proportion of that, and some on top for the driver s time and effort, unless you are able to share transport with another or more, that would keep the costs down.
remember that you get what you pay for.
three hours is nt far, but you are doing multiple shows.
some people are willing to take your horse, but they really have old trailers that are not the safest in the world.
rusted, torn corners in the stalls, unhealthy air, straight load instead of slant load can all make travelling hard, if not downright dangerous, on your horse.
i had my horse transported from ca to wa and he came on this big, open stock trailer.
he was dehydrated when he got there and lost weight.
since then, i now use a professional horse hauling service with people who ride with my horse to keep an eye on him, stop every few hours for water, and their trailers all have super smooth suspension.
all horses i ve had delivered to me since then are happy and healthy when they arrive.
i would call bob hubbard transport and get a quote.
even though you may not want to use them, it will give you some idea of what it might cost and what is fair.
see link below.
make sure the trailer service you use is bonded  insured and knows something about first aid.
do they have this anywhere
i want to take a cruise around the world.
i mean literally around the world if possible.
first of if i went alone on a regular cabin how much would you estimate it would be just a guess.
second is there any way to sort of customize the places you wan na go to
like you can pick the destinations
but if not just say no but i hope there is like one out there somewhere.
1. here s a site that lists world cruises including prices.
httpwww.cruisecompete.comspecialsregionsworld1
prices listed, however, are usually based on two people in a cabin, and you will likely face some high  single supplement  costs in addition.
two people in a cabin will spend more onboard, so cruise lines charge you more to sail alone.
you may be able to do better on the rates if you request competitive quotes via cruisecompete .
2. short of chartering your own ship and crew, i do nt see any way you could customize your own itinerary.
good luck
various world cruises from most of the major cruise lines, typically 100 days in duration.
travelling on your own you would have to pay double as cabins are sold on the basis of double occupancy.
no possibility to customise ports of call.
prearranged about 18 months in advance as the cruise lines sell segments all along the way i.e transatlantic to london  england , england to barcelona  spain , barcelona to alexandria  egypt , egypt to india via suez canal etc.
yes there are multiple around the world cruises, mainly offered by the more upscale lines.
however  you will pay as if there are2 people in the cabin, even if it is just you.
so any price you find, double it figure,  40 k at least.
and no you can not customize an itinerary unless you book several different legs of a cruise with stops in between on shore .. say book a panamal canal crossing, then fly to asia and pick it up again and sail to india then fly to europe to sail the med before flying to england to hit the transatlantic corssing.
was the san francisco bay area mostly caucasian back in the early 1970s
no.
there has been a large asian presence in the sf bay area for a long time  the chinatown here was the largest population of chinese outside of china, there were lots of japanese who d been displaced during wwii.
the whole western addition and a large portion of the haight was black.
the mission was basically latin  american.
as the southeast asians and philipinos came over, they added to the cultures.
so, the bay area has been fairly mixed ethnically for a long time  caucasians may have seemed to be a large populous but that s because most tourists back then were caucasian and many of the hippies were caucasians so that s who the photographers took pictures of.
the other ethicities were nt well represented in politics yet  or rather, they were just breaking the color barrier in the 70s due largely to the more open  minded hippy generation.
marin county was predominantly caucasian and many of the expanding outer east bay areas started out as white suburbs.
it was not so long after civil rights laws against discrimination started to have an impact.
you never saw black muni drivers, asian police, latino politicians until then.
it was an evolution.
many illegals were not counted in the population until the mid80s.
we did not have big percent of chinese migration until the mid 90s.
we had fewer people running across the mexican border then.
we had fewer social benefits at that time for people so many immigrants were not counted.
only caucasians had any political power, corporate presence or owned businesses except for mom and pop stores in some neighborhoods.
san francisco was settled in the 19th and 20th century by mainly european immigrants except for some asian workers who were manual laborers.
there has always been a mexican  american cultural influence since calif was owned by mexico.
we had a larger black population in the 70s than we have now but they did not have any power until willie brown was elected.
san francisco was always progressive and welcoming and tolerant to all kinds of people historically.
the counties outside san francisco were more white than san francisco in the 70s.
edit  my memory may not be good so you might get a more accurate answer from someone else who remembers the time.
can rabbits and chickens live together
i am thinking about getting a rabbit as a pet, but my parents said that it has to stay outside.
we also own two chickens that are kept in a run behind out garage  barn thing.
there is already a little dog house that i would turn into a little rabbit hutch being kept back there and i was thinking about keeping the rabbit in the run with the chickens, but keeping the chickens in the coop and the rabbit in the hutch at night.
however, in the day time would it be okay for the rabbit to hop around along with the chickens
we feed the chickens scraps of veggies and fruits throughout the day, but it s nothing that a rabbit would nt be able to digest just fine.
so, can rabbits and chickens live together as long as they have separate places for their food and water
the rabbit hutch would have an opening only big enough for the rabbit, the chickens would not be able to get to the rabbit food  also, is it okay if the rabbit occasionally sneaks a few bites of chicken feed
my last rabbit did that a few times, and he was fine ...
i just wan na make sure  thank
yes, but be sure that your chickens are all hens  i mean not roosters , roosters may attack rabbits or anything they see moving, so be aware of that, hens are friendly with almost all kinds of pets
from my experience hens  not roosters  are very friendly with duck, guinea pigs, kittens, cows, rabbits, etc.
be sure not to feed your rabbits nonveg items
you said they live in different cages and they are free in day, so no problem, do nt put both of them in one cage because rabbits bedding is different than that of hens, wet bedding can cause diseases in them
so, do nt put both of them in one cage.
good luck
yea i guess but rabbits a easily escape a pen or another rabbit could get in there and that rabbit could be the opposite gender.
so be very careful and some feeds could be toxic to rabbits and safe for chickens.
rabbits do burrow also so do nt be surprised if chicken are falling into holes.
rabbits are delicate and can get diseases so watch out for that.
melting brass did not work
my friends and i are trying to melt bras to make some little figures.
we have made a furnace as such, we took a clay flower pot with a hole in the bottom put a piece of steel pipe in the middle of it with a cap on the bottom, filled the pipe with brass scrap, surounded the pipe with charcoal lit it off and pumped air through the hole in the pot, everything got red hot but did not melt.
what am i doing wrong
i would recommend to start with something more simple like tin, pewter, aluminum or zinc, they all have a much more reasonable melting point.
i ll just echo both other answers.
molten brass is damn hot and usually it s pressurized gas and forced air or oxygen.
even if you did melt it, i doubt you foresaw the issues of handling it and pouring it.
it s really too advanced for a beginner, both in tooling and safety.
just the zinc fumes will get you, if you do nt take precautions.
pewter is perfect for what you are doing, and it melts on a stove top.
i would recommend to start with something more simple like tin, pewter, aluminum or zinc, they all have a much more reasonable melting point.
brass has an even higher melting point than bronze and i would think your charcoal just does nt get hot enough.
i bet you also did take charcoal as it is used for barbecue which does not get as hot as real coal  e.g. for blacksmithing one needs coal, not barbecue charcoal .
i have done a fair amount of metal casting, but never tried to build my own furnace, but i think your version is just too small and does nt get hot enough.
i have melted small amounts of bronze in a crucible with a large propane torch  much larger than the plumbers torch, but it can be run of those propane cylinders you can buy for a gas grill .
i melt brass and cast it httpwww.mikegigi.comcastgobl.htm
brass melts at just under 2000 f which is a bright yellow heat, not red hot.
httpwww.mikegigi.comtechspec.htmselctemp
you might be able to make a version of your setup work, but it would take quite a bit of charcoal and a lot of forced air.
i use propane with a blower and a burner i built httpwww.mikegigi.commeltmetl.htm and httpwww.mikegigi.comfirehole.htm
should all uk towns and their cafes or restaurants provide halal food
some friends of mine visited dartmouth in devon whilst on holiday last summer.
they could not find any cafes or food shops that provided halal prepared foods.
it s important to their religion that they only consume halal food.
even if you buy a cake in a baker s you can not be too what happens in the kitchen, for example the cake may have been sliced using a knife used for preparing ham.
it s simply not just a case of avoiding pork, alcohol and only being allowed to eat halal prepared meat, but the kitchen and its utensils should not have been used for prohibited foods.
places like dartmouth are supposed to be tourist towns and should provide foods for people of all religions.
we all enjoy buying a snack when visiting a town or attraction while on holiday.
not everyone wants to bring packed lunch.
it s not fair if some people have to go without buying food because no place will provide suitable food for them.
i think it s only fair that nowadays every town should provide at least one halal cafe or restaurant and hopefully one day every british catering establishment will be halal.
when i went to bosnia, all the meat was halal.
i will not eat halal meat, so guess what, i opted for foods which were nt a meat dish, there were plenty of other options.
i could not go to their country and demand they slaughter and sell an animal as meat the way i prefer to eat it.
when you go to another country, you live by their way of life and their laws, if you do nt like it, you know how to get back out the country  but i guess our benefits system is too much to throw away, huh .
cafes and restaurants rarely use the same cutlery for different food groups anyway, they normally have blue for bakery items, red for cooked meat, brown for raw meat, etc  all for food preparation and hygiene policies.
no.
to prevent animal cruelty, many countries forbid halal and kosher meat.
switzerland is one, and the netherlands are passing the same law.
it will become eu law in a couple of years.
we ca nt dictate what business wants to open where.
if someone thinks there is a business opportunity then they will start opening halal only places.
how to convince my parents to let me get a ball python
they do nt know anything about ball pythons.
when i ask my mom she says she will never let a snake in her house.
she has no experience with snakes and has never held one.
i did all my research and am well prepared to keep one, i m 14 by the way
lay some knowledge on them dude.
maybe if they see how much time and effort you ve devoted to researching the animal they ll reconsider.
tell them it costs like8 dollars a month  if even that much  to keep it fed.
be helpful around the house to show that even if you ca nt pay for it yourself that you re willing to work for it.
once you ve buttered them up a bit try to get them to the pet store and ask one of the employees to handle the snake showing your mom how gentle and harmless they can be.
maybe even try to get your mom to hold it a bit.
my wife was terrified of snakes when we first met, i introduced her to one out my baby corn snakes and she fell in love with it.
be persistent, but do nt pester them about it cause that ll get you nowhere fast.
good luck
my general convince your parents to let you get a reptile advice
1. be responsible.
do all your chores without being nagged, take care of any existing pets, keep your room clean, and so on.
prove, to your parents  satisfaction, that you, not they, will be the one actually taking care of your new pet.
2. save up, and research, so that you are ready for your new pet.
3. bargain with them.
offer to do extra chores, ask for your pet as a reward for good grades, something like that.
4. play the sympathy card.
if you can find a pet at a shelter, or that a friend needs to get rid of because they re moving or whatever, you might be able to talk your parents into  giving it a good home  where you might not be able to talk them into buying a new pet.
on the fear angle  talk her into coming to the pet store with you.
once you re there, ask if you can hold a ball python.
once you re holding it, try to get her to touch  pet it ...
my snake s meal is too big, what can i do
just today i bought a medium rat for my beloved ball python salazar  name after harry potter .
last time i got a medium rat it was a girl and my snake handled her easily.
but today, i got a boy and realized that he is huge
i really do love my snake cause she is actually an affectionate cold  blooded creature.
so my true question comes to this, how can i knock the rat out
if i threw him against a wall and still conscious he will run away, do i hang him by the tail so the blood can flush into his skull
i really do need answers and advice, and not insulting answers
like seriously
best answer shall receive points
iw ould just stick him in the tank and let your snake have a nice hunt for once, snakes jaws detach for this sort of this thing, so why not give her a good hunt, but if you do want him knock him i d just throw him against the wall or something ,, lol i do nt know, i agree with you though throw him, haha
ok so if youre snake will take prekilled, you can  gas it .
just put the rat in a sealed tupperwear container with no airholes and wait until it passes out and dies and then feed it.
if it wo nt take prekilled and you usually feed live then you could hold the rat by the tail and whack it against a hard surface, like a refrigerator or wall.
i do nt like that option though  i think it s pretty cruel and id not done properly you ll end up really hurting the rat but not stunning him enough to stop possible injury to your snake.
i would do the tupperwear idea tbh  easiest and most humane.
you could also just wait until the rat passes out for about1 minute and them feed it  at this point, it could still have a bit of a heart beat and be slightly still alive.
and also maybe try holding the rat in feeding prongs so your snake can get a good hold and grip on his prey.
good luck
just my opinion here  no judgement  getting your snake on frozen  thawed will prove to be much easier for you and safer for your snake in the long run.
my opinion  take it for what it s worth.
looking to move to toronto
i am a 20 something gay black male and i am looking for suggestions on neighborhoods close to the downtown toronto area.
im moving from south carolina so this will already be a huge culture shock.
any suggestions
being gay and living in toronto is just fine.
you may consider the gay village on church street, right downtown.
it is full of gay friendly  everything .
but, you could live where ever you fancy takes you.
for obvious reasons, knowing how extremely difficult it is to drive a car in the city, you should probably try to be near the subway system.
but, can you immigrate
being an american guarantees you no favours when it come to going to canada.
start your process here, if you have nt already.
marrying a canadian is not enough  that does nt count for at least two years.
httpwww.cic.gc.caenglishimmigrateindex.asp
a normal processing time, unless you have an advanced degree or a  specified  skill is from3 5 years.
coming to stay, and overstay your three months visit will lead to immediate expulsion and a lifetime ban to immigrate to canada  not good.
let s be clear about this ...........
just  wanting to come to canada  is not enough.
you must apply, to become a immigrant, and wait to be approved, by the canadian government.
your education  the more the better  and your past work history, combined with a clean fbi and state police record, and a satisfactory financial history  no bankruptcies or large outstanding debts in the usa  are all taken into consideration.
it is a competition, and you will be competing with hundreds of thousands of others, from all over the world, for a place in the line up.
if you have not begun the application processs now  you are about2 to3 years away from being approved by immigration canada.
so do nt pack your bags, yet.
whatever you do ............... do not try to come here with out legal permission.
you will not be able to seek work or take a job, in canada, with out having to show your immigration visa and canadian social insurance number card to any potential employer.
being an american and from the  south  you will be noticed as soon as you speak out loud.
do it properly, and legally, and you will be ok.

how to train my puppy
i have a4 months shih tzu puppy.
recently i m having trouble training him.
he is kind of hate walking with leash, every time i put the leash on, he will try to bite it.
and he is not following me when i was walking.
i saw lots of videos about this, but actually it did nt help.
is there any way can let him know how to walk with leash
and every time he see some one he will rush to people and jump on them, does nt listen to me.
he is really excited about anybody he see.
how to prevent this
last thing is every time i sit on a chair or something higher than him, he will try to jump on, if he ca nt, he will bark all the time until i let him get on, what should i do with this
anyone have any suggestion
thank you very much.
hi, i am a dog trainer for 25 yrs.
you need to purchase what is called a shoulder point harness.
this type of harness goes around the dog s chest and legs and has a clip for the leash up on the back of the dog in middle of shoulder blades.
this way, he can not reach the leash to chew it.
when he swivels his head to go for it anyway, tell him sharp  uh uh  gently correct him with a small tug and continue your walk.
do this repeatedly and frequently and he will learn to walk on a leash.
patience is the key here.
he is a young pup and will learn over time and consistency in his training.
and always, always train with love and positive methods  never hit or harshly scold.
never train out of fear.
you want your dog to admire you as his pack leader, not fear you.
good luck with your puppy
all the best.
put him in dog obedience school or call a professional dog trainer.
why do nt you get some treats that he loves and only give him them when he does something right.
or, as i saw on embarrassing pets on tv, get a clicker type thing and treats as well.
try to train him to heel, which means to walk round you before he needs to go on a leash, and he may do that.
or you could even spray some scented spray on the leash and he will go for the scent and probably, if you act quick enough, will stay on the leash.
what sort of hotel could i expect to find in new delhi  agra  varanasi for rs 500 per night
hey guys.
i m looking to visit india with some mates at the beginning of february next year and i am wandering what standard of accommodation we could get for rs 500 per person per night.
there would be four of us so we would probably be looking at2 twin rooms for rs 1000, close to the centre of these cities.
this would be on a walk  in basis as we want to have the freedom of finding a place that looks good  not relying on pictures from the internet  and is in a spot we like.
thanks in advance for sharing your experience
sorry, almost forgot to ask  would it be cheaper to walk  in to these hotels rather than pre book
in delhi i d recommend ajay guesthouse.
travelled to delhi twice and stayed there twice.
rooms start from 500 per double.
those ones are quite small.
must say, in delhi it s hard to get good price  quality rating.
i have found this hotel in the lonely planet guide.
it s in an area starting with a p, many tourist hotels there and the location is very nice.
but in general, delhi is the hardest place to find a nice clean hotel for that price.
in varanasi i do nt know.
i ve stayed in a more expensive hotel there, but you can check some travelguides or tripadvisor
also, while travelling ask people where they ve been and if they have any hotel recommendations.
in agra i ve stayed in a place fellow travellers recommended, they found it in the rough guide.
it was nice and close to the taj.
it was quite easy to find something.
do nt stay in agra too long.
one night is enough
there were many hotels there.
i ve paid 500 for a double room there and it was fine and clean.
good luck, enjoy your time
you may find a normal budget hotel for rs 1000 per night in the cities you mentioned, the links below may help you to find good hotels in delhi and agra.
httpwww.goldentriangleindia.comdelhihotelsindelhi.html
to stay in delhi  hotel aster inn is best to stay in delhi.
it is in karol bagh.
some beautiful locations like close to karol bagh shopping market, presidential palace, and birla mandir temple and connaught place and jantar mantar are near to it.
to stay in agra  hotel atithi and aditya palace is perfect for you.
it is centrally situated.
to stay in varanasi  sandeep hotel is you choice ...
which one out of these makes the best pet
a degu, a rat, a mouse, a hamster or a guinea pig
and why is the one a better pet
get a guinea pig.
i have a hamster, and mice and rats like to escape.
the guinea pig is better because it s a lot larger than a hamster, rat, mouse, or degu.
so if you lose him, he is easier to find, because smaller rodents just love to escape from their cages.
so my opinion is guinea pigs.
plus they do nt stink that bad
depends on what you want in a pet, to be honest.
also depends on the space you have, how much time you can handle the pet, how much money you can spend, etc.
i ve had experience with all of those pets except degus.
my favorite would have to be the rat.
they re incredibly social, highly trainable, and very clean.
mine learned to  go to the bathroom  only in their cages and loved to ride on my shoulder or hang out in my hoodie pouch.
the only downside is they should be kept in pairs or trios and require a pretty large habitat.
that means expense, space, and they require weekly cage cleaning.
my second favorite would have to be the guinea pig  not quite as social with people as rats  at least mine was nt  but more so than most hamsters or mice.
again, pairs or trios and pretty big living space.
they, too, need weekly cage cleaning and can cost quite a bit.
i could handle my mice, but they where skittish and preferred their cage.
i ve never met a hamster that did nt bite me.
never had  handled a degu.
get a guinea pig.
we have two.
they are social and like to be handled.
you have to have two because they do nt do well alone.
make certain you get two females.
two males can fight and you definitely do nt want babies
guinea pigs  also called cavies  are gentle creatures and are awake during the day and sleep at night.
they will whistle when they hear you as an encouragement for you to give them a treat like leaf lettuce.
they love leaf or romaine lettuce and tomatos, celery, cucumbers, carrots.
do nt feed them broccoli, cauliflower, garlic, onions, head lettuce .... they are all too difficult for them to digest.
also they ca nt eat potatos, they are toxic for them.
if you keep the cage clean they do nt smell and you can buy spray on cleaser for them, just massage it into their coat and groom them.
fostering6 week old kittens and hating it
need advice
i wanted to volunteer and help animals, and decided to try fostering kittens.
this is my first experience and i have two six week old kittens right now and am at my wit s end.
i do not want to have to bring them back before they are eight weeks old but they are ruining my apartment.
they track poop everywhere  most disgustingly my bed .... , and am constantly trying to climb up everything, including my bare legs
my legs and hands are just full of scratches.
i realize they are young and that cats do climb, but this is just ridiculous.
my apartment also smells repulsive even though i am cleaning out their litter box at least once a day if not twice.
any suggestions and helpful hints to make this a more positive experience would be extremely appreciated.
that s kind of the way it goes .. lol.
limit them to one room with easy to clean flooring.
if you have limited options, try the bathroom.
make sure there are plenty of litter boxes that are cleaned often.
depending on the batch of kittens, i will often have as many as one per kitten.
they can produce a lot of waste and even scooping twice a day they can get messy.
for some reason it takes them awhile to learn not to step in poop.
also if they have diarrhea, check in with your foster coordinator.
they made need medication or deworming or something.
they are testing out their claws and teeth.
to some degree you can  should help teach them not to use their teeth and claws inappropriately.
but in the meantime, highly recommend jeans and long sleeves anytime you ll be interacting with the kittens.
then take care of yourself.
get plenty of sleep and make sure you take time out to do some things you enjoy.
try visiting the kittens a few times a day for short periods of time.
try to go in there with the right frame of mind and enjoy them for what they are.
if you still do nt enjoy the kittens, see what other opportunities are available.
they may need foster homes for adult cats in different situations .. sick, recovering from surgery, need a little socialization, etc.
i find the adults are much easier.
generally they re not clawing and biting, they do nt make nearly as much mess, they do nt need nearly as much litterbox scooping, etc
decide volunteering is not your thing and give them back
and do more research before you agree next time
take the kittens back to the shelter.
maybe do volunteer work at the humane society, walk dogs, groom the animals etc.
what r the requirements to apply for a delay birth certificate in canada
what r the evidentary requirements to apply for a delay birth certificate in canada
including fees and forms
it depends on if you ever registered the birth.
some places do the registration right at the hospital .... in some smaller places, you need to register your child s birth at the town hall  registrar s office.
my first three children were born in southern ontario cities.
the birth registration was done right in hospital.
my last son, was born in northern ontario ....
i did nt know that i did nt register him in the ridiculous amount of paperwork i had filled out in the hospital and was supposed to go to city hall within 90 days.
two years later when i got around to filling for his birth certificate, i find out he was never registered.
i had to call the office of the registrar general in thunder bay, have copies of the delayed registration form mailed out to me, as they do nt have an online area for it yet, fill those out, send them away, then apply for his birth certificate.
if you are just applying for a birth certificate for the first time, it s simple to do it over the computer.
for  56 you can even have it expedited and will get in three business days or your money back.
this is in ontario of course, the rates may be slightly different for other provinces  territories.
you just need basic information, and answer a few questions like what hospital was the child born at  who was the doctor ....
none, just walk in to the service office and present all the identification you have to prove your identity.
they may then chose to ask you to bring more evidence, or just look up the record and hand you the certificate.
you can probably do it all on  line.
start here if you were born in ontario.
httpwww.ontario.caeninformationbundlebirthcertificates119274.html
if you were born elsewhere, start here.
httpwww.ontario.caeninformationbundlebirthcertificates119275.html
good luck
my parents did nt send for my birth certificate until i was 16 and needed it for summer employment.
it was no problem to get provided the birth was registered in the first place.
i add that in because there have been some people who have tried to claim citizenship by sending for their birth certificate when they were never really born in canada or to canadian parents.
when a child is born in canada the birth is registered before the baby can leave the hospital.
as long as that was done you can send for it at any time.
each provincial government has a website that lists the process for that province so depending upon where you were born you can google it.
royal caribbean or carnival cruise
only if you have been on board  both
i want to know which you liked better and why
include which one had
better food
more fun activities
more teens
and just more stuff you liked overall
please specify which royal or carnival ship
carnival and royal caribbean are two popular cruise lines that have strong followings.
some cruise aficionados refuse to sail on one or the other.
are there any major differences between them
explore which cruise may fit your needs the best.
for our comparison we sailed on two similar ships  the carnival liberty and the royal caribbean mariner of the seas.
itinerary both ships go to caribbean islands like jamaica, grand cayman, cozumel, st. thomas, the bahamas and st. martin  st. maarten.
the liberty also visited its private island half moon cay, puerto rico, and grand turk.
the mariner of the seas traveled to its private island coco cay and labadee  the north coast of haiti .
we loved most of the locations that both of the ships visited and do nt believe that this should be a distinguishing factor on deciding between the cruise lines.
shows each night there are a variety of shows.
usually you have the main show and some type of entertainment before and perhaps afterward.
we felt that the main shows on the mariner of the seas were better.
on the liberty we liked the comedian and juggling act.
if you love seeing the shows, royal caribbean was better for the main shows and carnival was slightly better for the comedians.
dining room we enjoyed the atmosphere of both dining rooms on the liberty and mariner of the seas.
we felt that the menu had a little more variety on the mariner of the seas.
friendliness of staff the liberty and mariner of the seas both get high grades.
we did have one waiter that complained some on one of our trips on the mariner.
we had a slightly better experience on the liberty, but feel that both crews did an excellent job and that this should not be a distinguishing factor on choosing a cruise.
pools the mariner of the seas and liberty both had salt water pools  which most cruise ships have.
they both had pools for kids and adults.
we liked the liberty s pools better because one had a slide.
if you have kids, this would be something that they would definitely enjoy.
spa we tried the spa on the liberty and loved it.
we did not try the spa on the mariner of the seas.
usually you ca nt go wrong when getting a spa treatment ......
royal caribbean is better, but the best cruiseline is regent seven seas.
look on their website rssc.com
royal caribbean.
carnival has been called the walmart of cruise lines ...
what countries are the best to travel to
i really want to travel when i leave school
where in the states could i go
where in europe
have you every traveled before
how long should i go for to each place
i have1 year before collage
also how much money would i need
so i can start saving now hehe
thanks
i mean when i graduate  yes, college, sorry for the typo.
leave high school
not the smartest move to take off on a worldly adventure if you ve never traveled before and you do nt put where you would be traveling from.
in the united states
lots of places.
there are 50 of them, 48 located from maine to florida and california to washington state and all in between.
there are2 more located outside of the main continent with alaska way to the north and hawaii in the pacific.
what do you like to do
big cities like new york, boston, philadelphia on the east coast.
beaches and disney of florida or the mid atlantic cities of atlanta, savannah, charleston.
the federal sites of washington, dc.
southern charm of nashville, birmingham, new orleans or charlotte.
west coast hot spots like seattle, portland, san francisco, los angeles or san diego.
europe
just as numerous as the possibilities of the us.
do you speak a foreign language
i could spend a year in spain alone.
from madrid to seville to barcelona an valencia.
bilboa on the north coast, pamplona and the very famous guernica.
a road trip to lisbon and the algarve in portugal before a mountain escape in the pyrenees and a stop in andorra before heading over to france and italy and austria and switzerland.
i ve traveled to all of these places and could certainly tailor a trip to your needs based on budget, actual time allowed, your likes and dislikes.
amount of time could be dependent on so many things.
do you want to see all the sites or simply a few photos and on your way to the next place.
does your budget limit you to how long you can stay in each place
you need a lot of money for hotels, airfare, seeing the sites, food, local transport  you name it but life costs.
once you have a budget or an amount in the bank then you ll be able to figure out where you can go, for how long you can go and what you can do when you re there.
1 year before collage or college
good luck.
i recommend buying a single unlimited europass and travelling anywhere in the eu your heart desires.
you ca nt beat the price for what you get.
come to africa.
nigeria, a lovely country.
but where in nigeria
obudu cattle ranch.
more than a tourist centre.
how do you make your cat adjust to a new house
me and my family are moving into a new house just outside a small town.
we are currently living a mile from the town in a house surrounded by fields but the new house is beside a busy road.
we have had the cat for 10 years and do nt want to leave it.
how could we make it settle in a new house.
you are not just moving house  your cat is losing his territory.
territory is very important to cats, and they are very nervous when they go into a new place  a new house could be full of predators, or unknown menaces  well at least he thinks so.
you will need to give him only a small place to explore, so he can make it his territory, and feel safe there.
then, he can have a place to retreat to when he feels scared.
you will need to get his box and bowls, and whatever blanket and toys are his, and smell like home, and put him in a room.
the room you sleep in is best  seeing you so relaxed that you are sleeping will send the message that everything is ok , but others will work just as well.
close the door, and keep him in there for a week.
he will feel much safer in that one room, than in a huge unknown house.
he will explore the room, mark everything with his cheek, and try to make it feel like his territory.
he will reassure himself that no other animal is in there, and that no other animal will come in  he is afraid that he is in someone else s territory when he is in a new house.
in a week s time, he will have made it his, and will be getting more bored than afraid.
let him out for half an hour, to explore.
then put him back in.
he will be freaked out, so going back to his territory will make him much happier.
extend the time he is out each day, but for the first month, always put him in his room at night, so he feels safe to sleep.
soon he will make the whole house his, but he needs that one safe place to start from.
remember to visit with him while he is in the room, and tell him how good he is.
remember to give him the time he needs to feel that the room is his  rush it, and he will be afraid of the whole house for a long time.
he might even start peeing on things in fear.
good luck with your new house and with his new territory
let her explore when we moved my cat had to explore the entire house before she felt comfortable.
in time though she  he will adjust.
they just do it on their own.
i just adopted a2 year old male german shepherd with major bad behaviors
last night, i adopted a2 year old male german shepherd.
he is 92 pounds  he does not listen to any commands, but my major problem is that he will not go outside on command, or even with me.
i will walk outside and he will stand at the door and stare at me or run away.
my other major problem is that he will not get in his crate.
i will get a treat and try to get him in there that way, it wo nt work.
he wo nt even get close to the crate.
if i come towards him, he will run away.
how do i train him to feel comfortable in his crate
and to willingly go outside ... and to come on command.
he wo nt do anything on command.
it s very frustrating.
i have a9 month old german shepherd that i raised from a puppy.
i trained her myself.
she is crate trained, potty trained, and can sit, lay down, stay, come, fetch, and will even stay in a down position while i throw a treat across the floor or even right next to her paw, and she wo nt get it until i give her the command.
yes, lots of time and lots of patients ...
i just do nt know how to do it with a grown dog.
she tosses me around like it s nothing
... but basically, what i do is the same thing i did with my puppy ... lots of patience, lots of time, lots of praise, lots of treats, and lots of repition .... right
is there any tricks i could use
maybe get a book on training.
you have to be in command at all times.
there are ways to get your new dog used to the crate or going out.
i would start with a leash.
put the leash on the dog and just walk around the crate a few times.
then take the leash off and do nothing else but that.
later do it again.
when the dog is ok with this, then open the door and walk around the crate, leave the door open all the time.
put something fun inside.
let your dog go in when he wants to for no reason.
do not shut the door.
let him walk in and out for a few days.
at some point he will feel ok with this and you can then close the door but not for long at all.
open the door and let him out and see how he acts.
if you push it, it will never work.
with going outside, put the leash on and just take him for a walk.
he will learn to really like this.
potty outside will come at some point.
try obedience classes.
have patience with him, you just got him and who knows how he was treated before you brought him home.
where can i find the best tours to the mekong delta at reasonable prices
will only be in ho chi minh for4 days and i am looking for a1 day or2 day trip to mekong delta.
i have been researching on line and find things are quite pricey but the tours look great.
should i just settle and book on line
or is it better if i wait till i get there
if i wait, would the tours i find there for less money be the same quality type tours
also, any tour recommendations would be very helpful a well.
thank you
if you want reliable and inexpensive ... try sinh cafe  tourist.
the are located right at 248 de than st. in the heart of the back packer district.
i have taken this tour and it was great.
i did an overnight in a home stay that was sweet and the water market was wonderful.
i do nt remember the exact cost but remember thinking how inexpensive it was.
also, sinh cafe has been around for a long time and is very reputable.
and no, i do not work for them.
i am just a satisfied customer.
and do nt expect to party on this tour.
the south is not like the regular tourist towns.
very few clubs and night activities.
oh, if you are confused.
sinh cafe is not a cafe.
it is a tour agency and they have their own buses etc.
tele  84838389593
have fun.
there is nt much to see in the delta, it s a lifestyle not a resort area.
if you re adventurous you can take a bus or water taxi to my tho  near where we live  or can tho.
from either of those cities, you can venture out and spend a day in the country.
most of the tourists that i ve come across buy tours along the my tho waterfront.
you take a boat across the river, then spend a day biking, eating at a local restaurant, buying souvenirs and doing other things that are geared towards tourists.
the countryside is very beautiful, especially if you have a few months  or years  to get to know the place.
ps, if you make it to thanh pho ben tre, stay a night at my friend ken s hotel.
it s called kiwi heaven and it s across the river from cho ben tre.
it s a little hard to get to by foot, they re rebuilding the bridge, but you can get someone to moto  taxi you there for a dollar or less.
he s an expat from new zealand and he s been in town for awhile.
he ll set up a real tour of the area for you, not some tourist fantasy.
have a good trip where  ever you end up.
we went with intrepid as a part of their north to south vietnam trip, but they do offer this one day separately.
we had a great time and visited a location where they made coconut candies, visited a local restaurant which was attached to a fish farm, rode in modified quad bikes and had some tropical food at what appeared to be a local hangout.
intrepid is good at getting you away from the most touristy spots and showing you something a little different.
yoga and horses .....
i got a riding lesson today on one of my boss s fino horses and it made me realize just how unsteady my left leg is.
i mentioned it to my boss and she said to start doing yoga.
but there are just so many poses and programs
any good poses or programs  i m willing to buy a dvd as long as it is under  20  to help specifically with leg stabilization
i just have a few issues supporting my back and my left leg flops.
because i do nt feel like spending over  20 on a freakin dvd
i also have back problems that transfer into my legs.
i have done yoga for riders for a while, a 20 minute routine i found on youtube  i think it s called  yoga for horse back riding  hosted by a man  it helped with noticing slight differences in my balance and weight distribution but not really for the way i use my legs and back.
here is what i do now and it really helps ....
when i first get on i take1 leg and pull it back up to touch my butt with my heel and hold it there for1 lap at a walk around a large dressage arena.
then the same thing with the other leg.
then1 lap at a walk around the arena with both my legs pulled out as far as i can, so they are not touching the saddle.
then a lap doing scissors, one leg forward as far as i can and the other back, then switch legs.
i ll also trot doing, down2 beats, up one for a wile, then up2 down1 making sure the weight is going into the balls of my feet.
if the weight is going into your heels  it throws your leg forward  put the stirrups up against the heel of your boot.
do a nice working trot, not a slow trot.
all this will help you use both legs evenly, keep proper contact and use your wight correctly, to keep your leg in a good position.
btw you do nt want your leg locked in place, it will move with the horse a bit.
when i first started doing it i d do it every day.
now i just do it once or twice a week or as needed.
now not only is my leg better, but my back is relaxing.
what are you having problems with
i would nt bother with yoga i d practice more with riding and fixing my problem, ride bareback, with no irons, there s also a way to ride on your knees
that help alot with your thigh muscles  bareback though
ya i really would nt bother with the yoga
maybe a back brase will help, sometimes my back really gets to me and i ve thought about getting one.
with your leg flopping, just try putting all your weight in your heel and hang on with only your legs, holding my leg back helps me with flopping the more it s forward the more it flops  work your calf muscles, maybe try standing on the edge of your steps  on the ball of your foot  and balance to strengthen those muscles
you do nt want to spend more than  20 and yet you have an expensive hobby like riding horses
i really ca nt help you.
what to feed my dog after gastroenteritis
my dog has been sick for about3 days now.
he has been having diarheya everywhere and he began to vomit last night.
i thought it would pass until he started to vomit blood and would nt drink any water.
i took him to the animal hospital and they ran blood work and everything came back normal.
no pancreatitis or anything abnormal.
the vet said it was gastroenteritis and gave him fluids under his skin, an injection of nausea medication along with some take home antibiotics.
so my question is ..
is it normal for dogs to throw up blood while having gastroenteritis
and will these antibiotics help
i have tryed to give him water but he wo nt take it .. what should i do
i do nt want him to get dehydrated and also should i try to give him a little bit of food
... some help would be great.
thank you
they did nt take x  rays they offered them but i just could nt afford any more treatment.
i feel like shit for saying that but after what they have done already i wo nt be buying grocerys for the next few weeks.
i will give them and call and see what they say.
thank you for the help.
ok so i spoke to the vet and he said the give him white rice and boiled chicken but only a little at a time.
seince he recieved the fluids last night he said not to worry about drinking water for at least a couple of days.
i went home at lunch to check on him and he is doing 1000 etter he was actually walkin around and wagin his tail  thanks everbody for the info it s greatly appreciated.
to answer your questions in order
1  it is not normal for dogs to be vomiting, much less to have blood in it.
however, if they have been vomiting numerous times, then the blood could be due to irritation of the stomach and intestines.
he could also have parvovirus, a gi foreign body, or any number of things.
did your vet take radiographs  x  rays
2  your vet would not prescribe them if they did nt think it would be helpful.
3  if he shows no interest in water, then take him back to your vet.
it could be due to nausea or any number of things.
he could become severly dehydrated  especially if he continues to vomit and have diarrhea .
from there you end up with electrolyte imbalances, which can lead to heart and kidney problems.
and being dehydrated, vomiting, and having diarrhea just does nt feel good.
4  call your vet.
they should have discussed a bland diet with you, including the frequency of feeding and how much to feed at each sitting.
it sounds like your dog may benefit from being hospitalized, and put on iv fluids to help his hydration, administer the antibiotics iv, and to ensure that he starts to recover.
you should absolutely call your veterinarian back immediately to clarify anything you have questions about.
they have seen your pet, and are most aware of his condition.
no one online will be able to assist you more than your vet can.
you need to ask your vet these questions.
boiled white rice and boiled chicken breast.
bland food.
no spices
my vet told me when a dog is vomiting a lot, it could be a sign of obstruction.
did they do any x  rays
i do nt know if vomiting blood is common with this ailment.
you should call your vet now and ask them what is normal or not.
french dating etiquette
i would really love to hear what the french or those who had dated the french to say something about this.
i m in my 20s and currently studying in france.
coming from an anglo  saxon country my version of dating is  getting the number, asking her out, etc..
however, i ve read on the internet that the french dating etiquette is totally different.
for them, dating would normally be meeting in groups or parties, then pairing off.
in addition, from my understanding one  on  one dates is something that comes much later and not  straight  away  like us anglo  saxons.
they are also very secretive about being in a relationship.
they only  go out in the open  once they have reached a certain level of seriousness.
is it true
i have told a french girl i liked her, and she accepted.
she is friendly when we see each other on campus.
she is also nicer when we are both alone.
however, when we are at parties or when they are people around she seems to ignore me.
she also seems to hate it whenever i ask her out on a date, to the point she said stop
my mind thinks she has no interest in me and just stringing me along.
but the articles i read seemed to say the contrary.
have i just fallen victim in a cultural trap
what you have read in the internet is fairly accurate but of course it does not fit all scenarios.
you are not french for a start, so the  rules  or  customs  may not apply to you when it comes to entering into a relationship between people from different backgrounds.
from what you say the messages given by this girl are quite clear.
she is not stringing you along since she is actually discouraging you and is honest enough to tell you to stop asking her out.
she is just being friendly in public because she does not want to offend you and she treats you like any other friend.
you said you liked her and she accepted it as a truth and perhaps as a compliment, but it does not mean she fancies you or wants to pair off with you.
at parties she does not want to be considered in any way attached to you, which is consistent.
take the messages for what they are  she has no objection in you being pals at uni, but she does not want to take matters further.
non   means  non , not  i might consider it, and i will keep you attached to my apron strings just in case.
christiane gave you a good answer.
you have fallen in a cultural misunderstanding.
what i have to add is that it is normal in france to have mixed gender groups of friends, there s nothing unusual in boys and girls being only friends, which is obviously what this girl wants from you.
she probably finds your company pleasing as a friend but you are not her choice a a boyfriend and she is trying to keep it on a friendship level, and trying to make you understand that she does nt want to go further.
if she is nicer when you are alone i d say it is because in public view she is making sure that people do not think that you might be her boyfriend.
you do find the  get the number hop in bed with her  but be aware that they usually have a reputation as sluts.
unfair for the girl as boys do nt have that kind of handicap, but that s the way our own rules work.
should have done research before you left.
why not just take your chances and do it your way
true or false  being a young new zealander means having no future
there are no jobs in this country.
i m just trying to make up my mind whether i should move to australia or seek work in the sex industry.
is there a future for our nation s youth
ryan b,
i m two years into an undergraduate degree.
everybody i know at university intends to stay at uni for as long as possible until there are actually jobs available.
everybody seems to flee this country and move overseas, to australia, etc.
there s obviously a reason for that  lack of employment, low incomes, etc.
your answer does nt do anything but remind me that i m going to be  25,000 in debt by the time i m 22.
so, thanks.
w.a.b.b.y,
i really like youre answer.
it s very logical.
i ve also considered becoming a teacher, but it s not a job i m cut out for.
i also wish i d applied for a scholarship.
i did nt think i d be awarded one, but i received the dux litterarum award at high school, so my chances were probably better than i thought they were.
obviously i m still completely stupid though.
i mean, i was nt smart enough to apply for a scholarship.
and yes, i am being melodramatic.
lol.
hatmanone,
gasps  so i would nt make a good prostitute
are you saying i m bad in bed
how would you know
joking.
your answer is very sweet, but i m not compassionate towards teenage high school students.
a little mellow dramatic
in my opinion, far too many people are at university studying worthless degrees.
yes things like philosophy and fashion design are interesting, but how many jobs are out there for someone with these qualifications
i m studying to be a teacher, so i know that there will definitely be jobs out there when i m done.
i may have to live somewhere rural or in auckland, but at least i can be pretty sure i ll be employable.
i ve also got a bachelor s degree so i can go back and do further study or take a different profession.
i also know that you do nt get paid that much more in australia than you do here.
and it s not all about how much you earn, cost of living is much higher in many cities in australia.
try living in sydney on a teacher s salary, then compare it to somewhere like central otago.
you also have to put up with all the annoying accents in australia.
it s probably not a wise idea to keep studying and having a massive student loan.
at the moment there s no interest, but that ll probably change.
and they ll probably add interest to what you ve already racked up.
and they re working towards being able to extradite people who have left the country to avoid paying it back.
at the moment if you move overseas you can only come back to new zealand for a short amount of time before they ll force you cough up.
and all that time you re overseas you ll be racking up interest.
i would nt like not having the option to return to nz.
i guess i m extremely fortunate that i received a scholarship which paid about 800 f my course fees through my degree.
but i worked hard and i m still working hard.
there are far too many lazy people out there who think that they can sit around a job will fall in their lap.
my2 c. ....
get an education
i m doing fine.
whilst youth jobs are thin on the ground, do nt assume it s better in oz.
people have been fleeing this country at roughly a plane load per week for the past 20  years, so it s not anything new.
it depends on what you hunger for.
700 f jobs are nt advertised.
that means making yourself known  that means networking.
why does my baby king snake refuse to eat
i have a baby eastern king snake.
i have tried everything i can to get him to eat but he refuses.
he has a great environment, with water and lots of hiding places and a heat lamp.
as far as i know, everything is as good as it can be where his aquarium is concerned.
according to the vet, he is healthy and looks good.
he has been going to the bathroom like he should.
i know that snakes that have problems going to the bathroom wo nt eat.
he has been drinking water  i am pretty sure he has been drinking it out of his bowl, but also i have been feeding him water and he does nt ever give me a problem with that  i just stick his head near the water and he sucks it down.
i handle him every few days.
he is feisty, as most king snakes are, but he is a very nice little guy  he never tries to bite or anything.
i just love him to death.
i do nt know why he wo nt eat though
i have tried feeding him5 or6 live pinkies and4 or5 frozen  thawed  pinkies.
i have never tried feeding him a pinky that was bigger around than he is.
i have tried putting him in a small container and putting him in a dark place for an hour or so and he wo nt touch the pinky.
he crawls on top of them but does not try to eat them.
he does nt seem to know that they are food.
i have tried  braining  both live and dead pinkies, and bloodying them up to get his attention, but he does nt care.
i have tried dipping both live and thawed pinkies in tuna juice, and in used gerbil bedding.
i have bought some long reptile feeding tweezers and have tried holding the pinky in front of the snake s face.
he wo nt even try to bite.
i am very discouraged and sad and i do nt know what to do.
he has nt eaten in an entire month.
i ve only tried to feed him one at a time.
he s just a tiny baby, about the width of a pencil.
do babies this small hibernate
when you feed him how many pinkies do you feed him
if you feed him too many he could just not be hungry.
if he does nt seem interested in them at all i would say he s just not hungry.
my boyfriend has one and when she s hungry she attacks the pinkie right away.
they can smell it so i m sure he knows what it is and just do nt want it.
remember snakes can go a while without eating.
in the winter, they will usually go deep underground and enter a hibernation  like state called brumation, which is characterized by a slowed metabolism and reduced activity.
king snakes sometimes stop eating, particularly during the cooler part of the year.
they have a natural instinct to hibernate.
if the snake is not pregnant or shedding, and its enclosure is properly equipped, a loss of appetite probably signals a beginning of hibernation.
hibernation is natural, and a necessity for snakes that are going to be bred.
another thing that can cause a king snake to stop eating is shedding.
you can tell when your king snake is about to shed, because its eyes will get milky looking.
its body will be dull looking, too.
in a few days the snake will begin to shed its skin.
for example, some snakes will routinely go off their food in both the summer and winter, feeding mainly in spring and fall.
it s natural and so long as you do nt see any serious deterioration in their health is nothing to worry about.
you see, some snakes for no obvious reason will simply go off their food.
they re fit and healthy and their care is suitable.
hope this helped.
that s why it s good to have a python
it s twice my size and eats a rabbit once a month.
are my two cats fighting or playing
how rough is too rough
help
i have a1 and a half year old male neutered cat and a new2 month old spayed female kitten.
the first night i brought her home i did the sniffing under the door thing and left it at that.
the next day i let her out of the bedroom so they could check each other out, and the kitten hissed twice within the first 20 minutes of meeting each other and now she no longer hisses and they have been playing  chasing each other up and down the hall, rolling around on the ground and pawing at each other .
only once it looked like my male cat was biting at her neck and then her stomach and she was meowing fairly loud and hissed once then he backed off and now they are fine.
were they roughhouse playing
or were they actually fighting
he has been  biting  at her neck and stomach previously while they play without her meowing or anything so i m wondering if he went a little to far that one time.
any answers help
you did not leave the new kitten in the room long enough.
you need to do that for a least a week, or else this type of territorial fighting will happen.
giving the new kitten her own small territory will help her to feel safe and will give her a place to go to when scared.
right now, your male is fighting off an intruder, and he feels that all of the house is his.
put her back in the room, and keep the door closed for a week.
then let her out for ten minutes.
make it fifteen the next day, then twenty, and so on.
this will do two things  the new kitten will rub her cheek on the furniture in her room, making it her territory.
she will start to calm down and feel safe  you can bet she does nt now.
she knows she is invading someone else s territory, but ca nt help it, and has no where to go.
she will be able to sleep without being afraid.
as well, your male will be able to see that his territory is not threatened.
when the door opens, he will get that the one room is hers, and he will be ok with that.
the territory thing will be solved.
your male is hurting her to put her in her place  biting her scruff is dominance and biting the belly is a move cats use when hunting  to pull the guts out of their prey.
this is not good.
give them time to set up their territories, and once you bring the new kitten out, pay a lot of attention to the male.
you have brought someone else into his territory, and he needs to be reminded that you still love him, and support his claim to his space.
that will help to reassure him, and he will be less aggressive with her.
when they play fight, they do nt hiss.
if they hiss, they are not playing.
if they bite, and one cries, you must separate them, and you must keep an eye on them.
hissing is ok, unless they start to fight.
if that happens, separate them, and give them time apart.
putting the girl in her territory will make her feel less afraid, and she will relax.
good luck
a hiss is basically a  get the fck away  sound.
it means they ve gone too far.
when they start bleeding that means they re really fighting.
if they re going kinda slow and like fake biting  not biting as hard as they can , and fake scratching  not hitting as hard as they can with their paws  then they re playing.
i have two cats, and at first they hissed at each other because cats are very territorial, but now they do fight and play.
the difference is when the cat hisses, that means they are annoyed and they want the other cat to go away.
that means they are fighting.
when they are just jumping at each other and their tails are wagging that means that they are playing.
i can see how you get confused though.
what was the goal for north vietnam in the tet offensive
when johnson deployed troops in 1964 he was advised by the military it would take a half  million troops about ten years to pacify south vietnam.
he refused to believe them and ordered the military to win the war within two to three years  before the next election in 1968 .
he did not give them the number of troops they requested.
this left westmoreland with few options, so he adapted a search and destroy strategy instead of a clear and defend strategy which is, in the long run, the preferred method of pacifying an insurgency.
thing is, it worked.
the arvn was not having a big problem with the local vc  the guerilla movement , they were being challenged by the main force vc  which was light infantry  and the north vietnamese army  nva .
when the americans swept in with their search and destroy operations the communists quickly leaned they could not stand up to the us firepower, and these regular troops were forced to flee the country and take sanctuary across the borders in laos and cambodia.
all those sunny reports about the progress in vietnam were correct, the communists were being defeated.
however, johnson would not let the military cross the borders and clean out the communist bases.
he was warned that they were building up a huge army and would eventually launch an attack, but he ignored his military advisers.
the communists agreed.
they could not defeat the americans.
however, what they hoped to do during the tet offensive was to sneak past the americans and attack the arvn in the urban areas where they were deployed doing successful clear and defend operations.
the communists thought they could defeat the arvn, cause the fall of the south vietnamese government, and the people would than rally to the communist cause and leave the americans stranded in a sea of angry peasants.
that was the plan.
what happened
the americans detected the attempt to infiltrate the urban areas and were already redeploying troops from the rural areas.
the arvn rushed back from holiday leave and counterattacked.
within 24 hours every communist assault had been defeated except in the ancient capital of hue.
the government did not fall.
and the south vietnamese people
when give the ultimate choice, they rallied.
to the south vietnamese government ..
tet was a huge military and political disaster for the communists.
they were chased back into laos and cambodia with the arvn in hot pursuit.
the people rejected their attempt to topple the government, and for all intents and purposes the us military  and the arvn  handed johnson the victory he had ordered them to achieve within the time  frame he ordered it.
all he had to do for a complete victory was allow the military to go into laos and cambodia and finish off the shattered communist forces.
but johnson was so obtuse he did nt understand he had a victory when it was handed to him on a silver platter.
instead he pulled the military off, stopped the bombing of north vietnam, withdrew from the presidential race, and spent the rest of his term in office trying to surrender to north vietnam.
they screwed up by not accepting his surrender when he offered it.
the american people were not having any of it, and elected richard nixon to fix the mess lbj had made  not to surrender like the antiwar movement was demanding .
in the end nixon kept his promise for . peace with honor ..
but that s another question.
to emancipate the south, but it was a serious failure.
to make the war unpalatable to the american public.
in that, they pretty much succeeded.
before tet, the war was unpopular but tolerable to the majority of americans in that the loss of american lives was seen as the cost of subduing the vc and nva.
tet made it clear that the war was a long way from being over if the americans thought they could preserve the south and that the north was perfectly willing to suffer great losses to continue their fight.
there is a very good book on the subject that was written by general vo nguyen giap.
try google to find the title if you would like to read it.
bearded dragon question ...
i just bought a baby one yesterday.
i have a basking spot lamp that says it is a double reflector that focuses 35  more light  heat and provides beneficial uva rays important to the psycholical well  being of him.
my question is does that mean it gives him not only the heat, but the  sun rays  he needs
i also was wondering how long should this light be on.
the lady at pet smart said4 hours, but on places on the net it says 10 to 12 hours.
he s getting used to his new home, but has nt eatin yet.
i have bearded dragon juvenile food and freeze  dried crickets.
any advice would be greatly appreciated.
thank you for your time.
let me try to break this down as simply as i can  diurnal  active during the day time  reptiles like the bearded dragon require3 types of  light,  uva, uvb, and heat.
any white light emitting light source will emit uva, including heat bulbs, that s the easy one to provide for.
uvb on the other hand can only be reproduced by a fluorescent source.
uvb will always be a separate bulb from the heat lamp, unless you use a mvb  mercury vapor bulb  which is the only reptile use bulb that will emit both uvb and heat from one bulb.
i highly recommend that you do not use coiled  compact uvb bulbs as they are known to cause severe eye damage and  or blindness in reptiles not to mention they have trouble maintaining uvb output over time.
the long tube uvb bulbs are best, like zoomed s repsitun model  httplllreptile.comstorecatalogreptilesuppliesuvbfluorescentlightsmercuryvaporbulbszoomed24reptisun100fluorescentbulb remember to replace uvb bulbs according to the manufacturer s recommendation after which time the bulb will no longer produce uvb even if visible light still is.
so, to answer your question, no, if you just have a bulb that says it produces uva then you do not have  the sun s rays  that your bearded needs.
you need to also provide a source a uvb lighting.
the person at petsmart is very wrong  in fact it is always a good idea to second guess what most pet store employees tell you  they do nt have the best track record regarding giving reliable pet care info.
uvb and basking temp  should be about 110 f for a baby, 95 f for an adult  should be available for 10  12 hours a day.
freeze dried food is not a good staple food source  you need to offer live feeder insects.
bearded dragons are sight hunters, they need to see the food move to trigger a feeding response, especially when they are babies.
live food is also higher in nutritional value than freeze dried.
crickets, silk worms, phoenix worms, and various feeder roaches, like red  lobster, turkistan, and dubia, are good example of staple insects to offer your bearded.
wax worms and meal worms should only be offered as treat items, for variety s sake.
i would highly recommend that you read through some reliable bearded guides to make sure you have everything set up correctly

mm it depends on the size of his tank or cage or whatever you have him in .. atleast as far as i m concerned.
if there are shady areas he can move to  for example a3 x5 x4 tank with light on one side  then you can leave it on a full 12  14 hours, if it s a small tank and he ca nt escape the light then4 6 at most at a time though quite possibly4 6 hours at a time twice a day.
either way you also need to keep an eye on the temperature if you are using a dry fish tank as uv lights in my experience up the temperature significantly and without proper ventilation it can become an oven.
as to what the light provides it gives uv rays .. which is important for health in lizards as it is in humans.
that lady at petsmart is a disgrace to the rest of us petsmart associates ... sheesh.
yes, it gives him the  sun rays  necessary, that s what uva is.
and it should be on 10  12 hours, just like the sun would be up for 10  12 hours in his natural environment.
as for the heat, just be sure to use a thermometer.
also, beardies often do not eat food that is not moving, so it s anyone s guess whether or not he ll touch the freeze  dried crickets or the processed food.
i tell all my customers they can try it, but do nt count on it.
also try green leafy veggies, like kale and spinach.
best of luck
is a finch or a parakeet better
i am making a christmas list for my parents and i was going to ask for a bird and these are the affordable ones that i like, and i was wondering  which would not bite alot, and which are more fun to have as pets and i need to know which would be quietest i honestly do nt care but my family does
please help me
oh and please say y one is better thx
hi there,
please choose the parakeet ...
here s my reason .....
i did the same thing that you did for christmas.
i ended up getting a pair of zebra finches for christmas.
at first it was all cool and all.
they were chirping and doing their every day business.
after a couple of weeks i got tired of them.
they are quite messy and you can not hold or pet them.
i ve tried to tame them and they just would not get tamed.
they do nt want to be held or touched.
i want a bird that i can hold and do tricks.
i still have them and they are doing well.
a couple of months after i got parakeets  budgies.
they are adorable they have beautiful colors and personality.
i love them.
first of all they are very tame.
i tamed them in4 days.
they can do tricks and they are nt messy.
the whole family loves them.
my parents even plays with them.
they are a big part of our family.
i hope this helps you with your decision.
they are both about the same noise level.
when choosing a parakeet look for a young one.
the younger the eaiser to tame  look for clean smooth feathers, beak, and clean vent feathers  the feathers around the butt .. dirty vent feathers means the bird is not healthy  look for a dark eye with no circles  the older ones have a circle ring in their eyes .
look for a lot of stripes in their head that starts from the beak and goes back to the back fo the bird.
the stripes are like hair the less stipes the older.
think of a balding man lol  look for clean feathers.
if you want a boy the cere  the nostrils piece above the beak  must be blue.
the girl has either pink or brown.
i would recommend that you get two parakeets.
but get either one male and one female, or two males.
do not get two females.
they sometimes do nt get along  you know how some girls are lol hahahaahh but for real though, two girls tend to fight a lot.
i have one yellow girl and a green and yellow boy.
they are the best
if you choose to get a parakeet this is a trick that i used to tame them.
however if you plan on getting one, then get more than one at the same time they need company.
my mom told me how to tame them and i was very happy with the results.
it took me4 days to get the new one to be able to step on and eat out of my hand.
these are the steps i used.
honestly they have worked for me twice with my parakeets.
hopefully they will work for you.
1  when you get the bird, place him or her or them in the cage.
leave them in there with food and water and such for about2 hours.
2  then place you hand in the cage.
i took the cage and place it next to the couch.
then i sat on the couch, placed one hand in the cage, holding a millet spray.
this way the will associate your hand with food, and birds love food lol  then i turned on the tv and watch.
this way they will see that your hand is good and it s not going to grab them or hurt them.
do this for about one hour.
you can take breaks if you have too  and repeat the steps after about2 hours.
3  after about day2, they will start to eating the millet spray from your hand.
do not take away the food dish from the birds, they will associate you as the person who takes away their food  ....
then take your finger and place it under their belly, in front of their feet and say up.
push you finger to their feet gently and say up.
the first couple of times they will fly all over the cage but as long as you do nt jump back or screem they will get used to you  they will have no choice but to go on your finger.
when they see that you ar nt harming them, the will go up on your finger when you say up.
4  if they are not going up by now you just got ta keep trying and keep trying.
do not hit, yell, or harm them.
you have patience.
do nt give up
after a couple of weeks mines knows when i say shoulder it means ot go on my sholder, when i say up it means to jump up on my finger, when i say up and out it means up on my finger and out of the cage.
and when i say go home it means to go in the cage.
good luck
they worked for me and i hope they worked for you
they are awesome
and that s my reason why you should choose a parakeet over a finch.
a parakeet is friendlier
parakeet.
they are normally quiet and it is easy to take care of them.
they are also friendly.
i have a parakeet named cookie. p
when is the best time to travel to ireland
my sister and i would like to go to ireland.
i graduate in the spring, and so we d like to go between then and winter.
we do nt want too many tourists, and since we ll both be out of school we can go anytime between the middle of june to early november.
we do nt want it to be too cold  not sure when exactly there fall is ... or what the weather is really like there during our autumn months , but we do nt feel like we need to go right in the middle of summer either.
we re both in our early 20s and just wanting to explore the beautiful country while we re still young and before our lives start to get even crazier
can anyone give me an idea of when the best time for us to go to ireland would be
people do not go to ireland on holiday for the weather, it is unpredictable.
one thing you can be sure of about irish weather is how little you can be sure of.
it may be shirtsleeves and sunglasses in february, but winter woollies in march and even during the summer.
and then there s the rain.
ireland receives a lot of rain, with certain areas getting a soaking as many as 270 days of the year.
county kerry is the worst affected.
the southeast is the driest, enjoying a more continental climate.
the irish weather works on the  four seasons in a day  principle, which basic ally means that you ca nt predict a thing when it comes to the behaviour of the sky.
some basic assumptions, however, can be made.
in summer, from may to july, the days are reasonably warm and  most importantly  very long  at the height of summer you wo nt need to turn on lights until after 10 pm.
it is also peak tourist season, which means there are far more people just about everywhere but the most remote corners of the island, and prices are at their highest.
not surprisingly, most of the yearly festivals occur during these times so as to take advantage of the crowds and the more favourable weather.
spring  february to april  and autumn  august to october  make good alternatives, although the country s ever  growing popularity as a tourist destination can often blur the lines between mid  and high  season tourism.
still, you have a better chance of some peace and quiet, and the weather can be surprisingly better in april and september than in midjuly  again, it s all part of the uncertainty principle.
spring festivities include the ever  popular st patrick s festival.
although temperatures do not often venture below freezing, winter  december to february  can be brutal, for huge parts of the country  the west and northwest in particular.
crowds are at their thinnest, but many of the country s tourist attractions and services close down in october and do nt reopen until easter, which paradoxically leaves visitors with a more convincing taste of how ireland is experienced by most of the irish  it s cold, grey and dark by5 pm, but there s always a pub to escape into when the rain starts sheeting down.
the thing to do is to bring the right clothing with you, clothes so you can layer up if it is cold and take off layers when it warms up.
waterproof clothing and footwear are essential plus an umbrella ..
as that famous scotsman billy connolly says  there is no such thing as bad weather just the wrong clothes
afraid i can not be more helpful, it is really a case of pot luck, although as the weather is so changeable often a cold wet morning will turn into a lovely warm sunny afternoon and evening or visa versa.
if you mean the republic of ireland  dublin  then anytime.
the summer there is much more mild than most of the us  are you coming from the us  .
their seasons are the same as all the countries in the northern hemisphere but i would suggest fall.
it does get pretty cold in ireland so going before winter is your best bet.
september for example.
rent a car and spend a couple days outside of dublin seeing the countryside and you will have the trip of a lifetime.
to explore the beautiful countryside you will need to be old enough to hire a car because public transport is expensive  only goes as far as the main towns  cities, most rural places do nt have a bus or train service.
you could stay in a city  get a bus tour to say the cliffs of moher or dingle peninsula but you will be with all the other tourists.
by definition most tourists will go to the best places so you might have to put up with a few tourists along the way.
best weather the past couple of years has been around late april  late may but it can pour with rain for days on end at any time of the year so be prepared with waterproof jackets  boots etc.
we only had a few sunny days this summer, barely 24 c on a few occasions, more like 14 c most days.
we used our bbq on precisely4 occasions.
autumn is from mid august onwards as far as the weather goes if not officially according to the calender.
the days start to shorten  it gets even wetter, windier  colder.
we had frosts in october so i would nt advise visiting late in the year to be honest, spring time is your best bet.
you do realise it is quite expensive to visit ireland
you are going to need a few thousand dollars saved up for flights, insurance, food, accommodation  spending money.
eating out in particular is quite expensive compared to america i believe.
golden wonder killifish breeding help
i have4 golden wonder killifish.
1 of them is really colorful and is about6 cm long.
2 of them are kinda whitish and are about4 5 cm long.
the last one is colourful too but it is about4 cm long.
i feed them flakes, and live earthworms uncut everyday.
can you tell me the whole process of breeding them and taking care of the babies
thanks in advance.
wow
if they are able to take earthworms uncut, that is really impressive
i aspire to your feeding regime, flakes early and something live later in the day.
worms  and daphnia  are also rich in lipids, substances important in forming eggs and growing young.
i think that you understand that your largest and smallest golden wonders are males.
if you would like more on sexing out aplocheilus lineatus take a look at the discussion in the first source below.
if you have plants in your tank.
your lineatus are already spawning.
if conditions are favorable  78  82 f  and the fish are obviously well fed as yours are, they will spawn.
i ve even had a pair of killies leave eggs on a floating thermometer
if you wish to pick eggs make a acrylic spawning mop.
check out the second source.
i prefer darker colors because i can see their eggs, more easily and the fish look better next to them.
use a well rinsed medicine vial, a cork, new fishing bobber or even a piece of noncrumbly styrofoam to float them.
there are a couple ways one could spawn lineatus  mop spawning  water incubating them for two weeks, picking eggs from a mop  putting them in a tray of treated, seasoned water or setting up the parents in a planted tank  moving them so the fry can hatch out there.
if you have the room to separate the male  s   females  s ,  feed them well on live foods,  assuming that you are doing weekly 50  water changes  when you put them together they will leave a lot more eggs.
just making up examples, but if a pair is constantly together, they may lay 10  15 eggs a day.
with extra blackworms and maybe frozen  defrosted, rinsed  frozen foods earlier in the day, they may leave 30  40 eggs at a time.
separated and feed extremely nourishing stuff, they may produce more.
separating a pair some time before a show  killies are usually shown  judged  often sold as pairs  will encourage them to court and show their best colors.
they also start the day with no nicks or dings in their fins.
the water changes help with that too.
you also may need to treat the incubation water.
the chlorine and ammonia  choramine  are not good for the eggs.
ironically sometimes it is wise to leave the newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs.
then put the eggs in water treated a couple of days before with a water treatment and left open to  breathe .
leaving a jar with a dozen black worms in it will sate the adult s desire for snacks and they are more likely to leave fry or eggs alone.
if a pair is nt leaving eggs ... check the following
1. is a tank mate  such as another female killie or a cory or large snails  rating the eggs
2. have we kept up with partial water changes
3. is there too much mineral in the water
aplo. lineatus are wide  spread over southern india.
that indicates that they thrive in different water chemistries.
still if you can get your pet shop to do a hardness or tds  total dissolved solids  test, that may give you a hint.
winging it a little here, a hardness of 100 to nearly 200 ppm  parts per million  or 5.8 to 10.6 dh should be fine for gardneri.
tds meters  the thrifty aquarist s hardness meter can be used if one has seen one of your municipal water department s annual reports.
they include a number of minerals there and you can figure out what percentage of that would be your hardness minerals  calcium, magnesium and iron .
a number of minerals are not of much consequence.
however if there is a high level of sodium chloride  common salt  that can break down the chorion  shell  around the egg and allow critters to get in and eat the yoke and embryo.
ironically sometimes it is wise to newly picked eggs in fresh tap water with some chlorination to kill microscopic critters that ride in with the eggs.
then put the eggs in water treated a couple of days before with a water treatment and left open to  breathe .
if you get eggs in the mail in a medicine vial, that is fine.
but get the eggs out, maybe rinsed in fresh tap water and then into the incubation water.
in time the eggs can suffocate in the shipping container.
after a number of people began complaining about  mystery deaths  among incubating eggs, some of the more advanced killie people began suggesting that after7 8 days of incubation, one should do a 100  water change  as the eggs develop, they do release waste material.
another problem is that sometimes bad eggs will fungus and the fungus will spread out and kill all the eggs.
some people put in a very dilute acriflaven solution to slow down the fungus, so one can take white eggs out with a pipette or eyedropper.
other will add a drop of methylene blue.
if an egg turns blue, it had died and then became dyed as the outer membrane broke down.
get those out asap too.
hope there is useful grist for the mill here.
disney cruise line with young ones
i will be taking my3 and4 yr olds.
what is the best time of year
should i get a balcony
any tips or advice to make this a great experience
thanks
it is vacation time.
many families are set to plan a best holidaying.
they look for fun filled, rejuvenating and memorable vacation.
there can be many ideas  one can see numerous options passing through their mind.
what is the best option
especially if you are planning to spend couple days with family and kids, which best suit you can select
disney cruises, is a simple answer to this.
there are many reasons to say disney cruise is the best bet for you to have a enjoyable holiday tour.
from 1998 onwards, from its inception disney cruise has attracted many and continue to attract more and more.
this is a spectacular ship, a very popular choice of families to spend their leisure time.
the ship is designed thematically, with imposing animated cartoon characters.
do you feel that the holidaying with the animated cartoons will impress only young ones
no, the luxurious facilities and fun filled activities in the disney cruise are very attractive to people of all ages.
whatever be the age, you will have the choice of variety of activities to forget about your hectic day  to  day activities.
kids fun games and video shows are added to the other facilities.
there are two ships, disney magic and disney wonder.
both are made keeping in mind the comforts of the travelers.
disney cruises offer 24  hour room services, and the crews are ready to serve you the way you like.
it has got very spacious rooms, furnished completely and neatly.
these are decorated uniquely and marvelously.
the ship offers variety of eatables, deliciously made.
sea fishes, prawns and many nice options are there in different restaurants aboard.
there are many good options of delicious food on the shores as well.
there are special regions uniquely and imposingly designed for the children.
they can spend many hours enjoying the disney world magic.
these theme parks have all types of facilities.
video shows, cartoon stories, wonderful games and many such facilities.
it is really an entertainment for the kids.
the amusing world of cartoons and stories will be a memorable experience for the children.
there are other amnesties also.
these include space for dances and music, bar facility, gambling facilities for the elder, spaciously made open area aboard and many such nice facilities.
also one can keep their privacy in the cabins and make the time in seclusion.
to relax and to rejuvenate disney cruise are the best option.
there are many online sites offering the booking facility with affordable rates.
you can select the proper route and travel plans by consulting the agents prior to the booking ........
off season is good, however, the disney cruises are almost always completely booked.
i would suggest a warmer season, but not spring break or early summer.
you may also want to avoid thanksgiving week and the christmas holidays.
we really enjoyed our balcony  coffee in the mornings, drinks at night, standing outside when docking and leaving port  however, it is quite a bit more expensive.
with young ones, i would definitely get a window or view room so they can see outside.
check out the kids  space as soon as you get onboard.
do not feel guilty about taking them there.
they have a blast so the sooner they get there, the sooner they can have fun.
we liked getting the late dinner seating, so you have more time to see movies and stuff but if your kids are  early to bed  you may want the earlier seating for dinners.
bring some sort of magnet or small magnetic whiteboard for your door.
all of the doors tend to look alike and having  something  on your door helps you and your kids find your room easier.
you can also leave notes for the rest of your family  husband  about where you are at any given point.
cell phones do not work on board but they give you a  walkie  talkie  kind of phone in your room that will work onboard.
each evening you will get a  magazine  called the navigator which lists all of the activities for the next day.
we always took ours to dinner and discussed what things we felt we  had  to do and which ones we felt like skipping in lieu of just chilling.
any time would be great.
off season cruises might actually be better with preschoolers as prices might be lower in the off season.
my wife and i, in our 60s at the time, originally planned a3 generation trip but some family emergencies caused everyone else to cancel.
we had a ball.
we had an inside cabin and it is what i would recommend.
there are so many things to do that you will only use your room for sleeping and the extra cost of the balcony is wasted.
the children can be checked in and checked out in a safe way at many activities so you can have a bit of free time without the little ones.
the range of activities can be illustrated by describing the water activities.
there is a splash fountain  no standing water  for little ones still in diapers  next is a wading pool for those who are potty trained  then a family pool  finally there is a pool for adults only with kids not allowed.
you will never be so spoiled in your life as you are on a disney cruise.
if you stay with your dining schedule, every night is dinner and a show.
the real payoff is that you will have the same waiter for the entire cruise.
our waiter quickly grasped the fact that i like ginger ale and rather spicy foods while my wife s taste ran to lemonade and less spicy fare.
since they knew our preferences, we almost always went along with their menu suggestions and were never sorry we did.
obviously they had a full beverage list including alcohol for adults who wanted it.
if you should miss a meal, you also missed a great show.
but food is always available and it is consistently good.
i think i gained three pounds in my week long cruise.
this is about my farrier, girls.
that s why i m posting here
help
i posted this in singles and dating too, so i ve just copied and pasted.
well, i ll try to make this short.
i have known this guy for a long time, but we ve never been good friends or anything.
he is my farrier  shoes my horse s feet  so i am technically a client if you want to view it that way.
well, almost two weeks ago he came out and did my horse s feet and was so flirty.
he always hugs me when he comes, but he gave me at least5 tight, long, back rubbing hugs while he was there.
we were also just talking about my horse s crappy feet and he mentioned.
well, if you ever just want to see me i ll come out and look him over and then we can grab a coffee after.
that has never happened before so i was kinda realizing at that point that he was a little interested.
right
anyway, so he ended up leaving one nail out of my horse s foot  i ve never heard of a farrier doing this  and telling me to call him in a few days  first it was a week, then it was a few days lol  and he d come back out and put it in.
he told me to remember to call like3 times before he left.
so, i waited a week to call because i was busy and i wanted to have him come out on a day when i am more available in case we were to hang out after
anyway, so that was2 days ago that i called and left a message, but he still has nt called back yet.
i do nt know if i should call him again tomorrow or not
i know a lot of people say to wait until he calls you, but it s different because i m a client and technically that s all i am at this point.
on the other hand though, if i m a client he should really of called back by now because you do nt leave a customer hanging.
he did nt have my number either because this was the first time i ve called him instead of his dad.
it s a father and son business.
anyway, i would appreciate any insight on this at all.
thank you for reading if you did
ok, well as far as him being a bad farrier for leaving a nail out  that is not the case, they are extremely well known farriers in the area.
i would be a lot more concerned if the shoe fell off because it was missing one lousy nail.
the reason he said he did nt put that nail in was because he  did nt want to risk it  with my horse s horrible feet.
this is about the fourth time they ve done my horse s feet because i just switched back to them.
the only reason i switched away from them in the first place is because my good friend who apprenticed with them was starting out on his own.
however, he left my horse without a shoe for two weeks  now that s what i call a crap farrier .
which, i might add is the same foot that keeps crumbling with the nails.
so, obviously i switched back to these guys.
ok, calm down, it s not like he s some stranger that came up and groped me lol.
i ve known the guy for about 10 years.
i am 21, so yeah we were both kids when we knew each other
he is a few years older than me.
and yes, i do like him.
to answer barry white, yes that did occur to me  i hope that is all he s waiting for.
on the other hand, he could very easily just call me and say hey i m busy right now, i ll call you when i can come out.
and as far as scheduled visits go, i have no idea.
i ve never done that before though either.
it s always just  okay, theyre feet need to be done, better call the farrier.
and they usually come out within a few days.
he will call you back i m sure
sounds like he really likes you ..
but you need to ask yourself do you feel the same way
would you like going for  coffee  with him
or is he not your type
or are you undecided
if i were you i would go ...
i would say if he does not call you back by friday call him again he could be playing hard to get
i think he left the nail out of the shoe as a excuse to come back and see you hey he may be your prince charming ..
edit ... i really do nt think your horse is in danger of being hurt with one nail missing ..
i have seen horses loose nails on there own and do just fine with one nail gone now if he had left out2 or3 i would be wondering to ...
i really do belive he left the nail out becuse of the horse s hoof condition and it s a added bonus he would get to see her again
when i was younger in my early 20s my farrier was a hottie named joby ..  for those who do nt know i am a girl read my bio on my page  dumb as a post about everything but horses ..
he was in his 30s divorced and had2 kids .. but we both flirted horribly with each other .. but neither one of us took the chance and asked to other on a date.
sort a wonder what it would have been like
but that was years ago.
he had this habit of telling you everything ..
well one day he said to me you know i do nt wear underwear as he was bent over working on my mare s right front hoof .. and i was like ummmm okay
i m glad his butt was facing me so he could nt see my red face i think my mare was even laughing ..
well6 weeks later when he came back out he was again working on my mare s front foot and i looked down and yeah he had wholes in his pants in the wrong places i bust out laughing and he was like what
i was like ummmm i can see your ass cheeks ... he was like oops did i forget my underwear
that was a strange way to flirt .. but i guss it was his way ...
but like i said nothing ever came of it .. the next time i saw him he had told me he had to get married to a girl who he worked with becuse he knocked her up ..
i was heartbroken .. but then realized he was not the guy for me ..
wow he does sound interested in you, my farrier never gives me hugs like that  probably a good thing as he has a wife and2 kids  anyway, i find that they can be very busy so i would wait a week lo9nger and if still no reply give him a call but do nt leave a message so you do nt have to necessarily wait for him to call.
from the point of view of a business, and client  operator relationships, he s doing a really shitty job.
leaving nails out so you ll call and have him come back out later
cute or not, i d call a different bloke because he s doing a subpar job at something he needs to be doing his best at, whether he s flirting or trying to ask you out or not, he ought to put quality first.
this is, after all, his business, and if he wants you to remain a customer why on earth is he doing shoddy work
epm, anyone dealt with it
might be something different
i have the opportunity to pick up a super nice6 year old for free.
he s not lame, but he s been having issues.
here s what the owner has said
i have a5 year old that lost all of his cheek muscle on the right side about3 4 months ago.
i chalked it up to possible nerve damage, because this is what the vet thought and the other cheek muscle was fine and he had no theeth problems.
so i sent him to the trainers the first of september to be started on the barrels.
i got him back the first of the month and he had lost some weight but attributed that to be worked everyday  i expected him to drop some .
he is now losing the cheek muscle on the left side of his face and seems to be dropping weight by the day.
had him to a dentist yesterday and there is no teeth problems.
he can eat all his feed and does nt drop any, but can not eat hay from lack of muscle to chew it.
he is gant looking in his flank area and is losing topline muscle.
the only neurological sign that he shows is that he barely drags his toes and sometimes has trouble with his right lead.
the horse i had posted about a couple weeks ago with the atrophied cheek muscles is down to his last resort for life.
i can not afford to treat whatever is wrong with him.
no, i have not done an epm test but have done an extensive blood panel and my vet did a neurological physical exam.
we elected to not do the epm test because there was no neurological signs.
he is still showing no signs other than the weight loss, and some muscle atrophy.
he eats all of his grain but it just takes him a while to get it chewed because of the lack of muscle in his jaws.
so i might get the horse and see what i can do.
i will be getting with my vet first and if i do get him, have the spinal fluid test done for epm and a titer test.
will be getting a copy of the blood results the owner has already ran as well.
my other theory would be wobblers.
i ll be having my equine chiro  acupuncturist out to do some work as well if i do get him ....
so any ideas
think i should do it
arby,
horse is out of state and not local.
owner is willing to meet me half way with him.
i will be calling my vet and chiro about him.
worse comes to worse, i m out of the   and have to put him down anyway or have a pretty pasture ornament.
he s still rideable currently and not having many issues under saddle.
this is a horse that i otherwise would nt be able to afford and even if i spend2 k and treatment i come out ahead of his purchase price.
i posted what the owner as said in paragraph2 3, that is not me to clarify.
she is the one that ca nt afford to do anything else for him in case he does nt recover fully.
he can eat grain and i already have a feed regimen in my head for the guy since he ca nt eat regular hay.
i do nt think it will be hard to keep his weight up so long as he can eat the grain.
i am not going to go pick up a horse i ca nt afford.
i am willing to pull the epm test and treat.
the owner is the one who is unable.
i will also be having my other vet up who s a chiro  acupuncturist to evaluate him for wobblers.
july is when he started to exhibit slight symptoms and the owner and vet originally thought it was just some nerve damage from something in the pasture with no visible injury.
he s only exhibited weight loss and some muscle atrophy, with the slight toe drag and a bit of trouble with the right lead  which could or could nt be related .
the horse is not in pain.
he s not starving.
he s dropping we
the horse is not in pain.
he s not starving.
he s dropping weight, but most of that came from being at the trainer s and being ridden hard for 60 days.
he s not putting it back on.
i know that i have the possibility of treating him and still having to put him down.
at the same time i do know people who have had horses come back successfully after epm.
i know this is going to be expensive.
i m willing to give it a shot.
gallop, i ve already read that whole site and been reading through research articles from the research colleges as well.
looked at studies, treatment options and such.
i will have the epm test done before treating.
the chiro  acupuncturist will be there to evaluate the horse for wobblers which is often caused by spinal compression and can be confused with epm.
if that is the case then acupuncture is nt going to hurt him.
it s actually one of the alternative therapies for epm
i think it is wonderfully responsible that you are going into this rescue eyes open and are getting the opinions of qualified professionals  and a bunch of yahoos  before you decide to take this horse on.
i do think some ya users need to work on their reading comprehension as i ca nt comprehend how taking a horse in as a rescue and getting it qualified medical treatment is abuse.
worst case scenario you fall in love and after spending thousands of dollars you have to put the horse down.
is that something you are up for
if so go for it and i ll give you all the moral support i can as you figure out what is up.
it is heartbreaking to try to bring a horse back and then have to put it down, but some horses are worth the risk.
if you feel this guy is worth it then i hope your vet can figure things out.
as to epm like shee said being in mi we ve had to deal with it.
pretty much every large stable has here.
our first diagnosed epm horse was back when there was no treatment in the us and only an experimental chicken feed additive in canada.
we hauled the horse to windsor and got him treated there.
that horse returned to racing and we did nt notice much difference.
we ve had a few since then, but none since our race horses began wintering in florida.
i have no idea if that is related or farmers are doing a better job of clearing out opossums now because they know opossums are carriers, but we have nt had an epm horse in at least 10 years.
i can say all of our epm horses were treated early when they were showing mild signs like shee gave and all returned to racing.
one horse even got his lifetime mark after being treated for epm.
we ve always liked big long trotters that do better on mile tracks then1 2 mile.
the only difference we noticed is that the epm horses seemed to do worse on the smaller tracks after.
it might just be coincidence or the fact those great big trotters with those extremely long backs lost a bit of fine coordination to get those gangly bodies around those tighter turns.
i do nt know.
msu does a lot of epm studies because of how common it is here.
you may want to see if you can get in touch with their epm group and get this guy in a study.
i know they did lab work showing that strongid c used daily could help prevent epm.
i believe they have a real study testing the lab work in real world situations now, but it may be some time before those results are released.
another thought with this being a mosquito season from hell could it be west nile
west nile can cause epm like symptoms and does nt always include a fever.
let us know what you decide to do.
you hate to see talent get wasted, but honestly i do nt think i could take in a horse right now these issues.
personally i think you should just keep on walking by.
you should have you chiro out before you decide if you want this horse or not.
if you have a good repoire  which i m sure you do  with them, they should be honest on if this horse is fixable to any degree ... not really sure what you want to do with him ...
even if you can figure out what is wrong with this poor poneh, there is always the chance for remission and then relapse so you may have to do deal with again in the future.
so all in all, put the money up front before taking on this horse.
a few hundred out of pocket now will possibly save you thousands once the horse is in your name.
could he have had a blow to the head causing this atrophy
or a difficult birth
was it always like this
or has it occurred since birth.
i also wonder if he might have had a slight stroke
i think if you can not afford to get him treated that you should not consider him as a prospect.
who knows what the future might hold, and it might be expensive
extremely bad customer service
do not go to this salon, especially if you have to get your hair straightened.
they did a very bad job with my hair and were extremely rude when i went back to ask them why it did nt work for my hair.
rude, insensitive, discourteous people
great doc
dr greenwalt fixed my neck from a snowboard injury and was way more effective that a regular doctor.
he did nt prescribe pain meds or other drugs, he used his bodytalk method which is unusual but the results are undeniable.
my neck is fixed.
he knows what he s doing.
our wedding 11708
we just had our wedding on 11708 and was very impressed.

i have never had a problem with their hours because i always go during the mornings.
they are great
prepared the road test with a driving ... prepared the road test with a driving school in edmonton, but my instructor only trained me in a narrow street, hence i took one 90 minute lesson from the noble driving school to learn the skill of changing lane, and found them very friendly and professional.
great doctor
dr. faris is a great doctor
i would recommend him to anyone.

great pub
had a meal in this pub and i have to say it was excellant.
it has to be one of the nicest pubs that i have been into in a long time, the decor is nice and it has a really nice garden and a lovely decking area.
good beer good service and what more could you want.
awful awful awful
this store is by far the worst verizon store i ve been in.
the salespeople are never available, the lines are always too long, and all the people want is a sale.
incredibly rude and i will not return to it.
is there no other verizon to go to around downtown  dupont circle1
great graphic design work
fresh design studio helped jump  start my own business by providing affordable and effective marketing materials  logo, flyers, posters ad design, and more.
they have unbeatable price in town and deliver on time.
i enjoy working with this architectural and graphic design firm and will recommend to anyone.
great surgeon
i needed wisdom teeth taken out.
dr. wallen and staff was excellent.
they were accomdating with my scheduled and work with my insurance to get payment for the surgery.
dr. wallen explained the procedure in detail and took his time with me.
staff explained insurance procedures and was very helpful.
everyone was very nice.
the best in the area
i ve been to quite a few tattoo shops around this area and stainless steel is by far the best.
i am very pleased with the tattoos that i revived from them.
the artwork is excellent and the prices are very reasonable.
i would recommend this shop to anyone looking to get a tattoo.
cathy  five stars for lake forest tots.
the program has been a postive experience for my children.
i have had all three of my children attend lake forest tots.
the program is well established and we have been extremely satisfied with the teachers, the programs and the director.
good job, lake forest tots
great wine  service
this place is so great
they have a great selection of wine from all over the world with all different prices.
the employees make you feel very comfortable and are very helpful, whether you are very knowledgeable or do nt know anything at all about wine.
check out their wine tastings every friday night
a
excellent customer service and honest feedback.
the team at bradley chevron kept my car running for well past its expected death
they are honest about  immediate  concerns versus  recommended  repairs and have very fair prices.
such a convenient location as well with coffee shop and bradley food and beverage right around corner.
needs to go out of business
they close whenever they feel like it, often well before their listed closing time.
their store is dusty, dirty and feels like you re stepping into the 1970s.
they do nt take coupons.
they have a credit card minimum.
this place is the opposite of quiktrip  crappy in every way.
where else can you go for  10 and recieve this treatment
awesome haircut at awesome price right here in palatine
who can pass up a hot towel and a straight edge neck shave
i ve had2 cuts now from georgia and have paid more in other salons  barbershops and have not received this kind of treatment or cut
baffled by the one  star reviews
i do nt get it.
this place is awesome, with a great ambiance and cool decor, and the food is scrumptious  and especially their signature banana split .
sure, some items are a little pricey, but cm on ... have you ever been out to eat in seattle before
i ve only had good experiences at adorn, i was greeted and offered a refreshment.
i highly recommend debi, she does an amazing job, i  love  the way she cuts my hair, extremely thorough and cross checks her work to make sure my hair is perfect.
i always leave loving my hair style.
best chineese food in the area
the food here is fresh and hot out of the wok.
the food is cooked fast by the two chefs on duty.
the lunch specials are more food than most people can eat for about 6.
it is busy every day at lunch for a reason, the service is fast and the food is great.
pure pilates
it is the real thing  i have been practicing pilates for over7 years and would not go anywhere else.
it is the attention to detail and the quality of the work taught at tomipilates that sets this studio apart from the others.
the teachers are highly trained and are expert at handling all types of clients.
i phoned this company for advice on our office refurb and although we did not use them in the end  as our building contractor carried out the electrical work , they provided me with plenty of useful information over an hour phone call and subsequently we are now using pjc as our electrical maintenance contractor.
thoroughly recommended
they really go above and beyond
for example, i actually forgot to feed my cat, and they went out of their way to take care of him.
additionally, when there was confusion  my fault , they left me flowers along with a personalized gift.
they have been 100  reliable and professional.
definitely recommend
heating system angels
seriously, can you imagine having to live through these last few nights without heat
i would have had to because with the economy the way it is i ai nt haves much monies fo repairs round the house ....
comfort zone came out and did my house heat on the cheap.
and it works
thank you comfort zone
slowest, unfriendly sstaff on weekends
there are three starbucks locations that i frequent.
i have a bit of experience watching the usual assembly line.
i also understand that weekend staffs are different than daytime staffs and not necessarily starbucks a  team or even full  time.
but this location has the worst weekend staff i ve seen ever.
skip te rest  this is the best
absolutely great
clean, updated room, friendly staff, safe location.
staff is super friendly, treat you as a friend.
can not ask for a better experience.
will be staying here any and every time i come anywhere near.
overall, joe is a happy camper who has found a great spot.
photos done well
i love hellada gallery
marek dzida the owner and photographer puts whole heart in his business  if you are into old fashion  not digital  quality photography this is best place in long beach as i think not many folks can do affordable traditional photos anymore i know marek personaly and i will always recommend him
bad coffee, do nt bother
ca nt you make a decent cup of coffee
you charge so much, yet you use the same grounds over and over again.
the coffee taste burnt and very bitter.
no amount of sugar and milk can mask it.
change the process, ppl
westfield and rt1 do it well, why ca nt u
home made product
i sometimes go into this store just for something to do on a sunday afternoon.
i love the people, the product and the service
nothing compares to a home made product that really stands the test of time.
the brick, ikea, and leon s have their place.
but furniture like this will truly be around forever.
the internet here is terrible.
like the previous poster said, the com lines are split between the entire building.
that s3 x worse than qwest dsl s lowest speed offering
the outward appearance makes you think this place is nice, but everything inside is cheap cheap cheap.
moving out as soon as our lease is up.
httpwww.speedtest.netresult1155244347.png
awesome
yes my g1 screen is back working.
they was about to charge me  129 ...
but i paid  100.
they save me from having to deal with tmobile ...
tmobile want to send of my phone and i did nt want to go thru that ...
3 days for get that ...
great service.
i would recommend them to anyone ..
great out night
you ca nt go wrong with tuesday prices, even if you get quite the mixed bag of comedians
extensive drink list and daily specials but wish they had a bit more on their food menu, although popcorn is a nice touch
other items  chicken fingers, wings, asian pizza, and yam and regular fries
their food and sweets are awesome.
but service is very poor.
attitude of staff very bad.
never gives a receipt.
sometimes even gives wrong dish.
so confused at the payment area.
line up is so stupid.
even if you line up.
to make a order you may have to go to back of line.
and then wait again.
not organised.
hair by nivine in eastgardens fixed my hair after i had my hair cut and colored at another salon i felt more confident and the girls are fantastic and i ve been going there now for2 years always happy and they care about my hair had my hair done for my wedding it looked fabolous
and there prices are really good
best food in northeast
there s a reason why frank mcclelland was named best chef of the north east reigon.
food here is absolutely superb.
everything is delicous and cooked perfectly.
the waiting staff is beyond impeccable  they refold your napkin when you go to the bathroom .
if you want great food then lespalier is the place to go.
i did nt end up buying my car here, but i did think the guy who worked with me was pretty cool  he was willing to budge a little on the price which means a lot to me.
also they will fill your tires with air and other small maintenance tasks for free, even if you did nt buy your car there
the best deals in town
before you buy anything in ny, make sure you stop by jack s first.
their selection is random, so what they have on a given week might never be available again at the store.
i love it for discounted beauty items and household appliances.
trust me, you go there once and you ll always go back
first time ballerina
my daughter is starting ballet this year for the first time.
i m a soccer mom so i was nt sure what i was looking for when it comes to dancewear.
the staff was very helpful and gave me exactly what i needed for my first time ballerina.
the service at instep was great
i would recommend them to anyone
outstanding service  quality at a very affordable price
this place is top notch and highly affordable
i would recommend it hands down and am a loyal customer.
i ve also sent over a number of friends to use the services here and everyone is extraordinarily pleased
thanks for doing such great work on my important pieces of clothing that always look great
tried crust on broad on3 occasions.
twice for dinner and once for lunch absolutely rude service every time
the staff will not even answer the phone for take out.
tonight, i called several times with no answer  btwn 530 and6 pm  and finally drove there to place my order in person.
there was not a customer to be found.
we purchased a new home but was unable to sell our old house so we contacted this property management company and they have helped us quickly rent out our house and keep it maintained.
since then we have decided to have them manage our other investment properties as well as we getting older and can no longer perform all the inquires.
great help
we just got our sunroom built by patio world and can say that i m extremely happy with the whole thing.
from the amount of time spent with us to explain things during the initial quote, to the communication through the approval process to the actual workmanship of the build itself.
i have nothing bad to say.
very glad that we went with them.
no customer service
employees seemed to be having a good time chatting and laughing with each other, while myself and other customers were completely ignored.
another person in the store stood there with an item and repeatedly tried to get a sales person s attention.
it was nt until he gave up and walked out the door that someone asked can i help you.
do not bring your car here
i got a coupon from pennysaver for this station.
yes, they accepted it.
however, during the test, they did whatever they can to get my test failed.
then, they sold me overpriced stuffs, such as oil tank cap, so that my car can pass it right away.
i ended up paying much more.
are you kidding me
i do nt get it.
spongy and sweet bread  microwaved  , heartless salsa, tiny dogs ...
you order at the counter and there is a space for tip on your credit card receipt.
the dude who grills the retarded dogs is rude.
if this is the best that tucson has to offer, i am out ta here ...
i called on a friday at 1230 complaining of a severe toothache.
dr. obina told me that his office closed at noon and that i should call him on monday.
i had been a patient of dr. olbina for9 years and had spent thousands of dollars on crowns etc.
there are plenty of good dentists in fernandina.
do nt go to amelia gentle dentistry.
good location
for a hotel like this you would expect some form of free internet.
what you get is a  13  day charge to access the internet through a slow 512  512 kb  s that you can only use to check email etc  read  no downloading .
other than that the hotel is in a good location and the breakfast is great
make you feel like a number
stay away from kids first west chester.
you never get a human on the phone.
it s impossible to get an appointment.
if you get caught in traffic and are a couple minutes late they make you reschedule ... for6 weeks later.
and worst of all your child feels like a number not a patient.
go somewhere else.
rcommended by bees, too
highly recommended.
joe removed a wasp nest for our condominium building and we appreciated the environmentally friendly method and prompt, friendly and informative service.
no spraying of pesticides
very professional.
reasonable rate.
we highly recommend joe and his wasp removal service to individual home owners and condos.
he knows his bees
suzanne, vancouver
very accomodating
we were in springfield, il for a family funeral from kansas city.
we arrived early and the staff was very accomodating to our families and the situation we were in.
the rooms were very clean, including the microwave and refrigerator.
this is a nice place, and i know we will return to meet my sister  in  law from chicago
great service and people
deb watson is the contact person and she and the rest of the staff were great
she continues to help me when needed even if i have a service question.
since i m usually at work late deb has stayed around to help me out when needed.
this was after i brought the car
service does not get any better
hidden gem in alpharetta
this french born, french trained chef and his creative partners offer a taste fresh, locally sourced, fabulously prepared food in the most unlikely of locations.
try their weekend  tastings  which you can learn about by getting on their weekly email list.
it s the best meal for the money you will find in all of metro atlanta.
le petit is the best place to get your nails done
it is very clean, staff is friendly, and i have never waited
i go every other week for the shallac  gel manicure which is only  25 and it truly lasts2 weeks
i love it.
pedicures are also great.
try this place out
i promise you will not be disappointed
amazing pictures at an amazing price
rendy is totally amazing.
she gave me amazing pictures at an amazing price and made my wedding day so memorable.
she was way easy to work with and made my wedding day so easy and she got some amazing pictures, not only of me, but of my family and friends.
she is amazing.
i would recommend her to anyone
so very delicious
excellent
november7, 2010 first time eating at caffe bella italia and it was a wonderful experience.
from the delectable antipasto misto to the spaghetti alla barese and the parmigiana and ending with gelato, all was mouth watering.
too bad they were out of the chocolate lava cake.
maybe next time they will have it.
service was excellent
sandy
beware of sharayu
hopless service, at the time of booking my car a lot was promised but delivered not even one tenth of what was promised.
apart from that in spite of my repeated attempts i could not get in touch with the manager to even lodge an official complaint.
my advise to all is i have fallen into this trap ... pl ensure you do nt
course has come a long way
hcc s new nine was a little shaky at first, but the new grounds superintendant has done wonders for the course
the comment below definitely needs to be retracted
come back and give hcc a second chance at least
it is a great course for local golfers to be proud of and all the comments in 2008 have been very positive
excellent physiotherapists
kusal goonewardena and his team of physios are unbelievable
i have been suffering from back pain for over 12 years and have been to numerous specialists, physios, osteos and chiros with no help.
it took the vigor team only4 visits to get me feeling normal
and now2 months after my last appointment i am better than ever.
thanks guys
they must have read these reviews and improved
my husband and i happened in on a whim.
we sat in the front dining area, it was very cozy and pleasant.
our server was quite attentive and the food was fantastic.
my husband has been a professional chef, so he is a good judge of quality food.
this was a flavorful, enjoyable meal for both of us.
rude rude rude
went in there and got my dog groomed came home to an uneven dog then took him back to get evened up what a mistake
she did nt even let me finish a sentence without insulting me and telling me how i should have said it
i wo nt go back
she needs to develop a personality
brought dog home and it s all choppy now
it s helpful to know a quite a bit about bull fighting.
if you watch a lot of fights  youtube  and research some of the history  httpen.wikipedia.orgwikibullfighting  you will find yourself enjoying it a lot more
also after seeing a handful of bullfights, i can say that they re a lot more enjoyable if you re smashed  bac  .15 .
all i can say is that i am glad i went in
the nurses are sweet as pie and the doctor is wonderful.
this place is about healing, not making a buck.
the followup visit is free
after going to the hospital and paying er prices ... there is no way i wo nt be back here
i will be back and telling everyone about this clinic.
thank you
i just like the fact that he was able to do the specific type of repair i wanted  a reball  and give me the longest warranty and even a lower price.
someone else i found that said they could do it but wanted to charge me more and give me less warranty.
it was a no brainer really.
i choose console pros and i m happy i did.
this place is bad.
it s dark, dingy  dirty.
the salads are limp and the rest of the food is nt any better  ok, the nachos are not too bad
this place may have been something sometime  but it way past it  sell by date .
i have eaten here twice in the past year and will not go back and can not recommend it.
top range of bike, cheap prices, excellent a
yep they fixeded my thumpstar in1 day.

ham s on friendly ... rip
this is the original ham s restaurant, expanded into a regional chain in the late 80s  but this one is no more.
victim of hard times and i suspect failing corporate management.
according to news accounts, the company is struggling.
i have many fond memories of my college evenings there long ago.
so long ham s ... you will be missed.
we are very pleased with the services of first glass window.
our window panes were so dirty that they needed a specialist to come and clean them.
we called few companies before we decide to hire them.
they came on time and completed their work quickly.
we were very happy how clean looked our windows.
if you have some problems with your windows, you should call them.
great help even near closing time
i came in to town for a week and forgot my trainers
oh no
i came in 30 min before close and the staff was super helpful.
they spent a lot of time with me and got me into a great pair of shoes.
i think they may even be better than the pair i have been using this past year
thanks run on
great
this is a perfect place to get your hair done.
i have gone there time and time again whenever i need to get my hair done or when i want a haircut.
when i get my hair done there, they use enough hairstyling products while it does not ruin your hair.
the service is great and during weekends it tends to get busy, but the wait is worthwhile.
highly recommend
i have worked with shannon as my massage therapist and intuitive bodyworker for years and have never been disappointed.
no matter what state i am in when i arrive, i always leave feeling better.
she has not only helped me through some challenging computer  work and sports related injuries, she was wonderful to work with throughout my pregnancy and beyond.
i highly recommend her.
best store in boothbay harbor
what a fantastic store, i love this place.
not the same old stuff that all the other stores have.
their items are very unique, great quality, great prices.
they also have the best tea i ever had, not at all like the junk you get at the grocery stores, i stock up when ever there because they are closed in the winter.
the best
dr. aster and her team have been a strong advocate in the health of both my daughters.
dr. aster is very kind an gentle with the children, but also positive and to the point with the parents.
she is and excellent doctor to have on one s team.
even though i live pretty far from her office i still make the trip so my daughters will have the best
my wife and i avoided doing some fairly simple electrical rewiring in our home for several years due to overall hassle and cost involved.
i finally called matt from bonafide and he made the project both easy for us and reasonable.
he was prompt, knowledgable, friendly, clean and just an overall great guy who obviously cares about his business.
i will reccommend his services however  whenever possible
real pros
i ve had writer friends describe horror stories with their printers.
i tell them  why not just go with these guys
richard joule and the gang are pros from start to finish.
they set out to exceed your expectations.
already i m considering future projects, and i can assure you that for my printing needs i will be choosing no other than atlanta paperback book printing.
i have been here3 times and all3 times it has been bad
they have messed up my order and .... the food was just not good
i had sonic in many other palces but for some reason this sonic is always just covered in grease and not good ...
i hope they get there act together ...
i am going to give it one last chance in next few months and see
i called them for an estimate and they insulted me when i ask them questions.
they are very rude and nasty.
please do nt use this moving company if you do nt want to  cry, have trouble and a bad experience on the day of your move.
they will give you a low price over the phone and on the day of your move they will change the price, i guarantee it.
you ve got maids did a fabulous job cleaning my home.
i am hiring them to come once a week now that they got my house to where they can maintain it for only an hour and a half every two weeks
satisfactory for sure with the sercvice
beats having one  cleaning lady  who took twice as long and did not do a very through job like the  maids  did
this place has the best baby and children s clothes.
especially high end keep sake sort of clothing that you just ca nt find in a lot of stores.
it is all very unique and you wo nt find any other baby wearing the same stuff.
i spent quite a bit because i spoil my little princess.
after all she will only be a baby for so long i figure why not enjoy it.
antique lighting, fixtures, chicago
great place for antique lighting
i visited their huge chicago lighting showroom and all i have to say is wow
lots of collections, many antique light fixtures, chandeliers, custom lighting etc.
i think they have the largest collection for chandeliers chicago.
antiques, vintage, contemporary  modern chandeliers.
i would recommend them for any custom lighting or lighting repair and restoration chicago
great food awesome food awesome service
i wanted to try someplace new again.
this place rocked.
brought my wife deb with me and she like the fried crab wontons and said they were good ..
we also had the bbq spare ribs .. good also.
i ordered the moo shu pork and it was great ..
i also ordered the neptune platter which was awesome ... so this place gets5 out of5 stars.
do not go here
i went to get my nails filled friday, by monday2 were broken.
i was not happy with the way they looked, very wavy, uneven edges, and with the exception of1, there is a dip in the center of each nail.
i also had a pedicure, and they cut my nails too short, one of my big toes looks like it s getting infected.
no way.
i m certainly no expert on asian food in fact not even a lover of vietnamese food but i wanted to try the real things here at a dong.
cold, slimy, tasteless however is the same in all languages and foods.
not good, not great, and again another disappointment in central iowa.
how do these places stay in business.
this town needs some food soul and this is not it.
worth every penny
my girlfriend and i ate at the grill last night, and our experience was amazing.
everything we ordered was prepared to perfection, and was presented perfectly.
the asparagus, seared tuna, and lobster tail were the best we ever had.
then the desserts came, and they were hands down the best dessert we ever had.
i will sum it up with, it was worth every penny
best chinese restaurant ever
it was the best chinese food i have ever had.
all the food tasted excellent, and with the new renovation of chairs and the bathroom, it is awesome.
the people working their are also extremely polite and friendly.
every time i go, kevin, the manager, will always remember my family and i.
overall, it is very family oriented, and i recommend it to everyone
furnace repair
tiger heating is awesome.
i had john and dustin working feverishly to get my exhaust motor replaced.
these guys were absolutely professional.
john was here in 45 minutes after i called on a 10 below zero early sunday morning.
if you need someone to help you out with your heating problems, i definitely would call tiger heating and air.
absolutely a wonderful company.
my family and i thank you
they suck
go somewhere else ...
wanted to buy a rhino 700 and a grizzly 700.
after searching high and low for a salesman, i was treated like dirt, and we left.
parts department blows, service department is even worse.
i live 10 minutes from cycle city, but i drove 50 mile south to peachstate powersports in lagrange, dealt with the owner, levi, and was well taken care of.
professional and inspiring
nigel from nidd design has always provided a first class service, from his advice and professionalism to the quality of his design drawings and planning applications.
his knowledge and expertise help smooth the way with any planning application, ensuring compliance with the building regulations.
once you have met nigel you will not want to work with anyone else.
he really does turn your dreams into reality for your home
we came at around 730 and they close at8 and wanted to try the specials but they were out for the day so i would say go way before they close.
got the crab rangoon which was great, tofu with cabbage which was spicy but good and shrimp satay which was also good.
def going to come back and try this place again.
bea was really nice and asked how the food was.
cute place also
as a native southern californian i can tell you that this is not authentic mexican food.
however, i still like this place a lot.
esp. the mole, tortilla soup, and guacamole.
margaritas are alright.
my only complaint is the queso.
it used to be fabulous, why did you guys change it
queso should not be watery  .....
update  never mind
they fixed the queso
thank you thank you
there are so many wonderful great places to dine in houston .... do nt. waste your time here.
i had the morelias enchiladas.
the sauce was dry and the enchiladas did not taste good. at all.
in fact my friend vomited after our meal.
maybe we ordered the wrong dish but my experience here was poor.
service was okay not great, we came for a late lunch.
i do nt recommend this place.
skylight repair
my skylight was making a horrible noise when the wind blew.
james bateman came the day i called and fixed the problem quickly and efficiently.
he also inspected my entie roof to see if there was anything else that needed attention.
he called the next day to see if everything was to my satisfaction.
when the next hailstorm blows through, i will not hesitate to contact james at team texas construction.
tricky short guy
the new management is tricky and talk you into getting video rental agreement.
to my surprise  20 deposit .... new movies not on shelf .. under the counter for telugu speaking people only ... or people who spend  30 or more groceries ..
that did it for me .. no more raina s.
besides parking is a pain .. cramped and unruly with kumon parents next door .... gives me heebee gee bees
small firm with great service
bloom legal was really attentive to my problem, and seth bloom took the time to help me understand the legal issue i was dealing with.
i much preferred the one  on  one service here to the experiences i ve had with bigger offices and firms.
while i hope i do nt have any need for a lawyer anytime soon, if i do i ll definitely use this firm again.
used their service for the first time and was immediately impressed by their professionalism  received a phone call soon after order was placed to confirm details  and the subsequent delivery of my gift  to split, croatia  was as requested.
the gift itself was exactly as described and pictured in the catalogue and of the highest standard.
would highly recommend to anyone requiring overseas gift delivery.
danny  australia
i love my gym
fitness unlimited is a second home to a lot of us gym members who work out daily.
if you are serious about working out in a noncommercial like atmosphere then you have chosen the best place to be.
this is the most humble gym you will every step into .... if you dare to work on your body do nt be surprised when you see how addicting going to fitness unlimited can be
overrated ...
this restaurant is overrated.
it is hard to find ... and the mexican food is bland, almost equivalent to eating out of a can.
the service is poor ...
i asked for a fried egg on my enchiladas ... and did not get it.
secondly, the enchladas did not come with enchilada sauce .. but chili ... like hormel s chili .. the cheese was american cheese
the chili relleno .. had no batter on it.
i googled restaurants in the area and fuji sushi came up and reviews were great so i made a carry out order of  l 17.
mixed tempura ..................... 8.25 shrimp or vegetable tempura  salad.
i was very happy with the customer service and even more please with the portion size, to go box set up and quality of the food for the price.
i m very happy and will definitely dine in and carry out again.

good pizza at a good price
i just moved nearby and have tried several of the local places, this was the first one and i should have just stuck with it.
the pizza is usually pretty good, the only bad one we got was on a friday night and it just needed to be cooked a little more, but it was still good.
their bbq chicken pizza is one of the better ones i have ever had.
horrible service
absolute horrible service from the parts department.
they are very rude over the phone and in person.
they talk down to you like they are supreme beings, if you hate your job so much then quit
how these guys can get away with being so rude with people is mind blowing.
i will never do business with sun toyota again.
thank god there are plenty of toyota dealerships to choose from in this city.
this is a good place
i have been here before and the service was absoulutely great.
they had a great selection of colors to choose from and their seats are super comfty.
i enjoy going there although i ve only been there once, i will be returning toda to recieve a pair of french tips and i will only go to the best and to me the best is here.
i reccomend you to go and enjoy their wonderful hospitality.
anna marie and govind are very sweet people, and the minute you steep into their school, the calm loving atmosphere takes over, and tension and worries stay outside in the street, whether or not you pick them up again after class is probably a question of practice.
a wonderful place, if you want more than just the physical side of yoga.
give yourself the gift of trying this place, to see if it fits you ...
they do nt seem to be interested in selling cars.
went there yesterday  we are trying to decide between two different honda models, so we wanted to test  drive both back to back.
the salesperson refused
claimed he was too busy for two test drives.
we were the only customers there
do nt waste time, just drive 10 minutes more down to stevens creek, they actually do try to help their customers there
ate here a couple times.
it is not a high end steak house, more of the cuisine brett enjoys in mississippi.
so, if you want a burger and fries, well, it is ok.
if you want a little cajunish food  it is good.
if you want a steak, well, this is not the best in green bay.
overall decent but if you are expecting a ruth chris type steak, this is not it.
eulogic
good place to be on a sunday night.
the beers were good, nice choice of beers as well, and as usual the mussels were great, the place upstairs is a nice addition to the bar downstairs.
filled up on too much beer and hence can not comment on the food.
but the menu had standard stuff that one would get at a belgian tavern.
if you are a handcraft beer person, this is a fantastic place to be.
perfect location plus
i moved into the tanglewood apartments in late 2008 and it s been a refreshing change.
i used to live at meadowrun and that was a nightmare.
the manager  tiffany  is actually very nice so i m a bit surprised by other comments.
she s very reachable and she has always responded quickly to any questions or requests.
plus she plans a monthly breakfasts and other events at the clubhouse which is a nice added benefit.
great service  deals  support this local business
i have used these guys for new snows, fixing lots of flats, used replacement tires, and oil changes.
they have the best prices locally and good customer service.
one guy is a little surley, but who gives a crap as long as your car s work is outstanding.
and they re usually able to help you as a walk  in, and they re fast.
overall  good stuff.
another great business bites the dust
the best cakes ever
a bit pricey, so i did nt go very often, but it was always a treat when i did.
the prices were worth what i got.
i m assuming they are completely out of business since i ca nt find any contact information.
i m hoping the bakers continue to do their baking out of another place, because it would be a shame not to have these cakes any longer.
super nice people, really good food
what i love most about this place, other than the food, is that eating here makes you feel like you re in a small town rather than baltimore.
the owners are really nice, they serve good food at a good price, and the option to eat outside on the deck  esp on the weekend whether there is hardly any traffic  is great.
one of my top5 places to eat in baltimore.
overpriced
this place is identical to the youngstown sports grille, so i imagine they are owned  operated by the same people.
the food is mediocre at best, and largely overpriced given the portion size and quality.
do nt even get me started on how expensive it is to drink there.
i have ate here3 times since they first opened, and the service has been poor each time, the staff always comes across as somewhat rude and slow.
apps4 salad3 entree 3.5 wine5  nov 07
enjoyed this cozy little spot with a group of8 folks.
service was excellent.
food was excellent.
wine was excellent.
i was feeling the need for some fish so i had the salmon which was very good but the steaks looked amazing and if i am in town again, i ll definitely order a steak.
a perfect place for a romantic dinner.
lots of  pretty people  dining inside.
great staff.
very helpful
they interviewed me, gave me tests in the software i included on my resume, and placed me in a position that i kept for several years.
reinterviewed and am going on interviews for a new job.
i m really thankful for the folks at hr office.
they are dependable, have great connections in the community, and are a great resource for finding a job.
i highly recommend them to all of my friends
great experience  consider checking out their puppies before buying from a breeder
i adopted a 3.5 month old yellow lab last winter from the dumb friends league.
the staff was very helpful in finding the right dog for me and the care my pup received was outstanding.
if you are on the lookout for a pure breed pup do nt forget to check out the shelters
my pup has a wonderful temperment and has been a wonderful addition to my family
food good, service poor
no silverware, asked for a spoon for my son s mac and cheese ended up having to use my tea spoon.
asked for bar  b  que sauce never got it.
never checked back with us once we got our food.
had to go the the bus boy s station ourselves to get napkins.
only one server, too buys talking with others i guess.
food was good, but service means a lot to me.
dr. chao you are the best dentist i have ever had.
you are knowledgeable, professional, gentel and kind.
i wish i had you as my dentist early on in my life  maybe my teeth would have been a lot better then they are now, however i am glad you are my dentist now.
even though you are expensive.
thank you for helping to preserve my teeth.
you are meticulous in your work and it shows in my smile.
con garage
i brought my car in for a simple emissions test.
i guess they figured me for an easy mark, and tried to explain that my car would nt pass unless i replaced a hose.
ten minutes later, i took my car down the street and it passed the emissions test with flying colors.
if you re a fan of herpes, being ripped off, and child molesters, this is the garage for you.
if not, go somewhere else.
rude service
even though i have never tried hoa salon but i agree with other reviewers that they are rude.
i called and asked about the price for hair updo and the receptionist or owner who aswered the phone refused to tell me, or even just give me an approximate price range.
he told us to stop by the salon and then he will tell us the price.
what kind of rude service is that
i do nt want to waste my time with them.
top notch eats
so here we are in manson.
manson
yes, manson.
right near chelan.
aka nowheresville.
and this litttle gem of a7  table restaurant is a complete and utterly wonderful surprise.
a short but wide  ranging menu executed with innovative perfection in a cozy hole in the wall just off the main street.
fantastic food served without pretense, very reasonably priced wine selections.
a great place to go for dinner after a day of wine tasting.
excellent service and reasonable prices
boutique stores dealing in children s clothing  gifts are often outrageously priced  who wants to pay 40 dollars for a newborn onesie
but i was pleasantly surprised to find that the purple goose s prices are reasonable  for the same products found at other area boutiques, the prices were 20  25  cheaper .
the service was also excellent  friendly, helpful and informative without being overbearing.
will definitely return.
consistantly poor
a lack of organisation, coupled with the distain for its customers, makes this the worst rental agency i have used.
chasing them on issues from the day i moved in  many of them still unresolved as i left  to all sorts of farcical issues with funds, after i left.... as soon as i could.
if you must use them, be vigilant and be ready to push, if you can go elsewhere then i would.
amazing night  great party spot
went to the willow lounge this past weekend for dinner and drinks ... place is awesome.
had to keep in mind that the a  c broke, i feel bad it was their opening
anyway, once that is fixed, this place will be amazing.
drinks were awesome, prices reasonable, and staff friendly.
this is an awesome date spot that the area seriously needs.
check out the willow lounge, you ll be happy
it s been a few years since i have been to ipanema.
but my wife and i first went there thinking it would be brazilian food  think lots of meat , but it turned out to be a vegan restaurant
and, i can say, this was one of my favorite places to eat in all of richmond.
amazing
do nt let the nondescript building entrance fool you, these are some creative and talented chefs ... two thumbs way, way up
excellent food, fantastic wait staff
i recently threw a surprise birthday party for my wife at fraiser s.
we had 30 guests for the event, and everyone came away from the evening impressed with not only the food, but the outstanding service as well.
the management was easy to deal with during the planning stages, and the execution by the kitchen and wait staff was flawless.
i highly recommend fraiser s for anyone planning a special event for friends, family or business.
fantastic store
i came upon this store as the building caught my eye.
it s located in the huge honka log homes building, by walmart off of evergreen parkway.
the store was decorated with furnishings  accessories.
the friendly crew working was great  very helpful.
this store is what colorado is all about.
also, i purchased some furniture last year and all has been great
its durability  look was perfect and i will definitely be adding to my collection soon
lovely people, great hats
i was saddened to see the reviews that claimed world hats mart has poor service.
it led me to believe that the reviewers simply had difficulty tolerating people with strongly  accented english.
the husband and wife who run this spot are lovely people.
we have had many conversations with them and they have always been extremely patient with me as i tried on multiple hats in search of the right costumes for my magic act.
i recommend them highly
do nt ever go there, not even if your car flips.
their service sucks to start off with, people are cruel and ignorant.
i m compeltly dissatisfied with their service and their products.
they do not have a return policy and even if their product sucks, they will not take it back
do not ever go here.
i prefer advanced auto parts over this crappy place with the meanest people.
and they thrive to get a customer.
do not go here .. thank you
horrible
i have been growing my hair out for1 year plus and went in to get1 inch taken off.
i walked out with5 inch long hair on the top,2 inch long hair on the sides, and 1.5 in the back.
my hair is uneven and it looks rediculous.
this woman should be working in supercuts ... if that.
this was a terrible experience and i hope that no one else goes through that.
do your self a favor and do not go to this establishment.
the worst burger king restaurant
i generally like the bk over the other fast serving restaurants  however, i regreted to visit this restaurant at my town.
this is a shame of my adorable town, branford.
i ordered a kid meal with a milk and found a bottle was half opened already.
i asked them to change it but they rudely said that it was okay.
disgusting french fries is very best menu.
do nt go, or you will learn how to waste your money.
disappointed
the bad  i was at napa recently and was unpleasantly surprised at poor waiter svce and subpar food.
we were a party of4 and none of us were particularly pleased with our dishes.
napa is all about wine but gives very short descriptions of the wines on their lists.
i found my initial selection satisfactory but the wine flight we chose to be poorly composed.
if you must go ask lots of questions about your selections since your expectations may as high as mine were.
highly recommended
we walked in to pick our little man at 10 minutes to closing and heard laughter from kids and the staff.
the facilities are more than adequate and the staff are just phenomenal.
their sense of humour and calmness when dealing with the little ones amazes me every time i walk in.
we have since moved slightly further away from the centre but it s worth the extra travel, as the care provided exceeds our expectations ... especially after a few horrendous daycare experiences elsewhere.
horrible
this has to be some of the worst pizza i have ever had the misfortune of ordering.
the crust was lopsided, thicker on one side than the other.
it actually had a hole in one of the slices.
there was minimal cheese and sauce and it completely lacked flavor.
i know new york pizza and this is not it
this was nothing like new york style pizza.
i love pizza and this was a complete and utter disappointment
i would not suggest this pizza to anyone
best quote ever my gate was stuck halfway open so i called a class garage doors dr services.
they came to my house in no time and started working on the gate.
they were very friendly and were able to explain me exactly what was wrong with it.
once they fixed it they answetred all of my questions with no hesitations and then gave me the best quote ever.
i know that if my garage door needs to be repaired, i will be calling a class garage doors
you will be happy at this store
allen tire was recommended by friend after my having bad tire experiences in temecula.
the store manager, jim smith, made an excellent tire recommendation for my newly acquired lexus.
tires were the right price and now the car feels like it is riding on rails around turns.
the store is clean, run very professionally and a pleasure to be in.
they know their job and you do not have to watch them to be sure everything is done right.
easiest time i ever had purchasing a car
excellent service, not only did they get the exact car i wanted win in 48 hours but the sales man also took me out to lunch.
very kind and reliable.
i highly recommend this dealership if you would not like to hassle on price and receive friendly service.
i have since purchased two cars from this dealership, the first one was from phillip and the second was from richard.
both were excellent sales men who put my needs first.
this place has done a great job of taking care of the usual maintenance on my hooptie.
i also never have to wait long for a yearly inspection sticker ... and never get the usual excuses other shops always gave me ...  the inspection guy is nt here today  .... for example.
today i went into kwik kar and there were two cars in front of me for inspection ... but i was still out of there pretty quick ... barely had time to read a chapter in my book.
extremely helpful and professional
as first  time home buyers, my husband and i found stephanie fairchild at prudential steamboat realty, extremely helpful.
she worked with us for over a year, helping us find our perfect home.
stephanie s knowledge of the market and properties in our price range, made us feel secure in our decision to buy when we did.
we would highly recommend stephanie to anyone looking for a home in the yampa valley.
we appreciated her patience, knowledge and kindness
great barber
firstly, the other reviewer clearly has never been to nick s, or he would know that nick only charges  13 for a haircut which is pretty much industry standard.
i have been going to nick for5 months now precisely because he does pay attention to detail.
i have terrible hair and he really takes his time to make it look right.
some of the younger kids that work there are a bit sub par, but if you wait for nick ... you ll be good.
ugh
got some nice  freshly baked  fruit squares, a personal favorite of mine.
took a bite, it tasted odd.
flipped the square over and saw it riddled with green mold
ugh
i called the store and the clerk giggled, and agreed that it was gross, but said it was not her problem.
she also refused to get a manager.
i left my number, or tried to anyway.
same clerk had considerable difficulty taking down a number.
i ll never go back there again
for cheap chinese food, this is the place to go.
i used to eat at places like new china or green buffet in troy, mo  nothing terrible but not that great.
now, i wo nt eat fast food chinese unless it s from this place.
the best value i ve found from a chinese restaurant.
i do nt live in lake st. louis anymore, but deliveries were always correct and the service courteous.
now i have to be in the area to get some lovin  sad face
amazing experience
my experience was amazing at providence aesthetics and medical spa.
jana kueck was nothing but professional.
she makes you feel like you are the most important person in the world.
jana made me feel very comfortable.
provided me with warm blanket and has soft music playing.
walking in the door you are made to feel happy and relaxed.
equipment is state of the art.
i would reccomend anyone to go see jana kueck and robin talley to see all the many procedures they have to offer.
dave is a patient and methodical teacher, who has a great ear and sensitivity for his students  passion and the direction they want their lessons to take.
also, he loves teaching so much, his price is unbeatable, but that does not change his level of skill.
dave has much to offer.
in just2 3 focused lessons, i m already now capable of picking up new songs off youtube guitar how to videos and am even writing my own orginals with confidence
jason
we love our new roof
we would like to thank you for the roofing job you did on our home.
everything was done on a timely manner and things were cleaned and picked up every day when the crew was done.
we also liked the way that ray checked on the job every day.
and when the job was done every thing was cleaned up and hauled off that same day.
we would not hesitate to use spears roofing again.
we have already recommended you to some of our friends
omfg
i fucking hate this place every time i go this hot chick shows up and i mean really hot but she is like reaaaally dumb and then their is this other chick that is realy ugly but she is like super smart she could be a scientist, but then their is this stoner who always comes here high and he always brings his fucking dog who is so high from the second hand smoke i think he is trying to talk.
anyway we drive around in my van and solve mysterys and shit
amazingly yummy
i just got back from france yesterday and just missed the food already
my sister in law told me about this amazing new crepe place in town, i was so excited i just wanted to go and test it out for my self
their customer service was perfect
their food was better then anything i had ever tasted.
even in france
i would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great atmosphere, amazing food, and great customer service
thank you roll up crepes
this is one of the worst places i have stayed, we cut out stay short and went to the mulberry.
even though they still charge you the days you booked but wo nt use, it is worth the get the hell out of this crap hole.
the whole experience shows a hotel managed by what must be a2 star hotel manager.
bad service starting from the front desk.
the best person is the valet.
short of that, avoid this place, as a silver marriott member, this is a disgrace.
best place in ames
i lived here for two years when the prices were a little lower  the places are very nice and clean, and in great condition
i really enjoyed the staff at wessex, also the manager sherri was always very nice and helpful.
the fitness center was great
the only problem that i had in2 years of living there was that the walls are pretty thin, sometimes i could here my neighbors conversations.
i would recommend these apartments to anybody
i absolutely loved living there.
the best service ever
i have never had better service.
my car broke down and roadside towed my vehicle to sussman kia.
they squeezed me in and had me back up and running in no time.
everyone was pleasant and very helpful.
the service department even gave me a ride home and picked me up when my car was finished.
the advisor kept me up to date and informed on the progress of my vehicle.
i give this dealer an a
i will definitely be bringing my car back for service.
heaven on earthhhhhhh
must try
a
this place is the best.
i hated sushi before but now i ca nt stop eatting it
nice service, and excellent food.
everything in here seems to amaze me
their grill dishes are out ta this world and sushi is just fabulous
i eat here at least5 days a week.
they have excellent sushi chef special rolls for a fair price and so is the grill orders.
a
juno and open i love you guys
no homo  d
friendly, fine food
the one  star review from 2005 is out of date.
there was a change of ownership a couple of years ago and service is both quick and extremely friendly.
the food continues to be very good  deli sandwiches, homemade soups, fresh salads.
the atmosphere may not be for everyone.
it is a bustling place where separate parties are seated at the same table  as in many european cafes , but if you are ok with that, the food is very good.
love the soups.
the new italian kid on the block
another italian restaurant in collingswood
do we need another one
only if it is of the quality of that s amore.
the menu has the usual but then they step it up another notch.
the arancini di riso  risotto fritters  are not to be missed.
chicken saltimboca was excellent and then there s the chocolate mousse that comes straight from heaven.
pay extra attention to the appetizers  the next time i go there i m planning on ordered a few instead of an entree.
auto towing is one of the best towing services i have used.
the first time i used them they arrived on time and towed car for me to the destination i needed.
the auto mechanics that work for auto towing are very friendly and informative and answered any question i had.
they have towed car for me a few times and i am always very satisfied with this services.
if you are looking for towing services that can offer you a good towed car service, then auto towing is the company for you.
a very satisfied new customer
as a very satisfied new customer, i wholeheartedly recommend united air duct cleaning.
they are professional, knowledgeable, and take meticulous care and pride in accomplishing their work.
not only were my wife and i very pleased, but i also had the air duct quality tested professionally by the home inspector that i regularly use, before and after united air duct performed their work.
based on the test results, the home inspector stated that the quality of their job was  excellent .
the best breakfast in solana beach
we love t s cafe
without a doubt the best place to grab a tall bloody mary and some eggs benedict.
t s has been a north county landmark for thirty years and with good reason.
family owned and operated makes sure the atmosphere is relaxed and the food home  cooked with style.
i highly recommend picking up a jug of their homemade bloody mary mix  definitely the best.
if you ve been to north county, chances are it s in your favorites list already.
prominent builders nj
prominent builders in new jersey are one the best building contractors, i was referred to them by my friend, i am so glad i used them for my home renovation, and addition.
they were very professional, respectful, completed the job on time, and well below my budget.
mike one of owners was awesome, he explained the detailed plan, and executed on time, i am always going use them and refer them to many friends i can because of the great job they did me.
great dude cut
great service, cool vibe, impeccable style.
i m a guy with tricky hair so getting that right is job 1.
after going through5 other places i finally found janice at alta moda.
not only was it a good cut but my wife and friends comment on my hair every time i leave ... saying it s the best look i ve ever had.
either i suck at my own style or janice is a genius.
looks like there s a lot of talent in this place.
worth every penny.
my favorite place at wildwood
i have been going to the wildwood, nj for over 30 years for summer vacations and always call the madrid first.
i rated it5 stars.
i am not saying it is a5 star hotel.
i am saying when comparing all other hotels in wildwood, this hotel has everything that we are looking for.
it is the hospitality from tom and staff, that makes it feel like a5 star hotel in the middle of the beach.
we prefer the layout of rooms and it is always clean.
when in scordia, sicily
if ever in sicily please take the time to visit anna maria jose mudo and her familia.
they are and always will be the nicest people in sicily that you will meet.
you will also have the pleasure of learning the italiano language.
you will also have the experience of learning the bella sicilian culture, that i have fallen in luv with.
i will4  ever be eternally grateful for their hospitality and luv that my sicilian family showed me when i was there for3 years.
luv always ..
i ve never felt the need to write a review or make a complaint before, but after the way i was spoken to by a member of staff at the kennels  whose name i believe to be mrs closs  i would now not recommend this business to anybody.
if the animals are treated in the same way the customers are treated then this leaves a lot to be desired
nobody should be spoken to like that regardless of how bad their day may have been or what may be going on in their private lives
best car dealer in tx
i purchased a nissan from this dealship.
the sales men were very knowledgeable about every aspect of every car we looked at.
they were very patient and helpful from showing the cars to doing the paperwork.
the paperwork was a very easy and smooth.
they tried to run my credit score as less as possible so it wo nt hurt my score.
overall, i was very happy with the customer service and my purchase.
if you re looking to buy a car, definitely give them a call.
they have a huge inventory.
i have been a patient a nw hospital and it was great.
i have also had an 80 yr old that i take of sent to the er and long stays in the hospital.
yes, we had to wait, but er is a triage system that takes the most life threatening cases first.
any er would be the same.
as far as being treated like a drug seeker, that has not been my experience.
as a nurse i know about drug seekers.
this is a great hospital and even better since it became part of the uw system.
wonderful experience
i had immense pain on a sunday morning, with friends and family telling me that i would never find a dentist on a sunday.
dr. taylor was not only available on a sunday, but also was able to immediately take care of me.
he was incredibly informative about the options i had, giving me opinions on different treatments to choose from.
coming from a person who hates the dentist in general, dr. taylor was the best
he really made the visit a pain free one with excellent service
i would recommend him to everyone
horrible
this school is the worst one i ve ever been to.
i attended it for2 years, and that was enough.
there s holes everywhere in the ceiling, sewage constantly leaks through the ceiling, and the whole condition of the school is horrible.
the staff and the principal are rediculous, they do nt listen to any input, and they make up rediculous rules  they banned backpacks, because a teacher tripped over a student s .
the education is horrible at best, do society a favor, and do not send your student here.
excellent customer service and quality work.
they went the extra mile to repair my cowboy boots  they had to have a special kind of paper that looked like wood grain to fix the heels.
that was4 years ago.
i have nt been able to find a shoe repair place in seattle since that has been able to do it.
i ve been through at least5 places already.
if i had time to drive to tacoma before they closed during the work week, i would just so i could get those boots fixed properly again.
so handy for local la jolla stuff  especially for finding residential numbers
since moving back from college and trying to settle roots in the village, i have referred to the la jolla blue book for a ton of local numbers.
the white pages allowed me to get in touch with parents of my high school friends so that i could track people down one by one and the restaurant section is basically my cookbook.
it s really cool that so many local businesses are found so quickly in one place and i want to spread the word.
thx
the staff do occasionally get game info correct, but if you r looking fot a good game and are nt a nerd, do nt ask them.
the last time i did that i was suggested to buy oblivion when i told them i was looking for a fps.
i knew what it was and told the guy that it was nt a fps.
he tried to tell me it was when i told asked him if he knew what fps stood for and he had no clue.
overall they are nt very knowledge about the type of games are on the market.
first and last time we ll eat there
my friend and i went there for lunch today.
neither one of us had ever been  so we thought we d try it.
big mistake  the food was tasteless and cold.
we both kept trying to find something we liked.
the only thing i found edible were the potato wedges, i finally gave up, he kept trying  he found the fried wantons to be ok  his mongolian bowl was awful.
would not recommend this place to anyone  in fact  save your money and go somewhere else.
liquidweb.com rocks
i am not a client of liquidweb.com, but one of my friend called steven is the client having several websites.
i work with him and since past6 years he is hosting his websites to liquidweb.
as i have gone through many reviews sites to see if any provider is providing better services or not, and i have realized that there were many good reviews about liquidweb also steven never faced any server issues in his whole hosting.
the kind of support they provide is simply great
i would like to host my upcoming website to liquidweb.com

simple but perfect
if you want flashy fancy food stacked high with lots of fussy garnishes, this is not the place for you.
if you want perfectly executed simple dishes that feature a few exquisite ingredients, you ll love vetri.
hands  down the best pasta and gnocchi i ve ever eaten  and i ve eaten a lot .
the antipasti were amazing, the wines were mind  blowing, the service could nt have been better.
i ve dined at lots of high  end restaurants and i ve never before felt my money was so well spent.
great prices, great service
i ve been to this shop twice  once for an inspection and again for an oil change  and they truly live up to their name  discount
they have all kind of coupons available for car washes, oil changes, state inspection, etc.
the thing is, you still get high quality service at nicely discounted rates
there is even free coffee and bottles of water if you d like.
the owner is a pleasant guy and i would trust my car with him or any of his workers.
top notch, all the way
david is amazing
david is the most helpful and creative photographer that i have used.
he is willing to do whatever you need from him without hesitation.
he was patient and adapted when everything did nt go according to schedule on my wedding day.
both the engagement and wedding pictures that he took for us we absolutely amazing.
he got the pictures back to me quickly.
i would highly recommend david to anyone.
he will exceed your expectations
he does nt just take pictures he makes art out of them and you wo nt even notice that there s a camera there.
not so great
my husband just got a bike there as a gift he s only had it a month.
it s a nice bike and it cost a lot of money.
but just this week a peddle broke.
he took it back and they would not honor a warranty and said it was his fault because of his shoes
so they were going to charge him for new peddles and proceeded to put them on without even telling him the price.
which was very expensive.
he asked for a different pair instead and they only gave him five dollars off
trek is not so great
only concerned with money
i have been getting my treatments for a few months now and have seen some results but not up to the standards that i was told i should expect.
the people there attempt to come across and professional and nice, but i was disappointed with their customer service.
never miss an appointment because they will charge you the price of a treatment, even if you had an emergency.
it s pretty ridiculous
they want to squeeze as much as they can from you even if you just got in a car accident
they do nt care one bit about you
terrible service
made an appointment to have them come to the house to discuss curtain options and give an estimate.
they sent over someone who said he knows nothing about curtains and could not show me fabric options or give an estimate.
when i called the manager to complain, she said she knew the guy did nt know about curtains and that the usual lady called in sick hours earlier
instead of rescheduling they chose to waste my time instead.
so what was the point of the appointment
to just come over and hang out
i will never do business with this company
ever
internet department is rude and insulting
i was looking to bring a customer to their lot to buy a car but the internet salesperson last name is balazick sent me this email  and if it was worth my time i would of bothered aswering your questions.
i make money not deal with brokers  wow, can you believe in today s tough times this dealership would be looking for any way to move vehicles.
as a previous internet manager i would deal with anyone looking to buy a car for a profit and not care if they came in with a broker.
stay away from this dealership
this place is a rip  off
i brought a car in to have the  check engine  light diagnosed back in march of 2010.
they said it was  plugs and wires  and quoted me  330 to do the work, including parts.
i asked why so high and they said it was due to the labor of moving things out of the way.
those things ended up being a windsheild washer fluid tank 1 screw  and the air filter canister 4 spring clips .
i did the work myself for  50.
there s no excuse for that kind of estimate.
my girlfriend and i took a chance on this place because we did nt want to wait in line at outback.
what an amazing find  this restaurant is a gem.
1 it s immaculately clean.
2 the decor is tasteful and artistic, from the comfortable chairs to the elegant light fixtures .... and  most importantly  3 the food is fantastic.
this is authentic cuban cuisine  fresh ingredients expertly prepared and seasoned perfectly.
the portions were generous and we got out for less than the cost of one entree at some chain restaurant.
try this place  you ll love it.
thank you for helping me get more healthy
i came in and saw dr. ruona about a month ago for quitting smoking.
i have to tell you that i have nt had one and do nt want one.
it is the easiest thing that i have ever done and i tell all my friends that they should do it too.
i sent a customer of mine to you.
dr. ruona, if you read this, thank you for helping me get more healthy.
i feel lighter and feel that i have more possibilities open to me now than i did before.
i ca nt thank you enough.

fantastic for kids
if you have children or are just a real animal lover yourself you ll love this zoo.
it s only  10 and in essence just one big petting zoo.
they sell feed and milk bottles at the front and i recommend you buy lots.
we took our7 month old and she laughed and giggled when  very harshly i might add  grabbing and  kissed  the goats and lambs.
the animals were all very sweet and patient with her.
among the animals that were available to touch were ponys, camels and even an ostrich
wonderful, inexpensive and lots of fun
wow
i ca nt say enough good things about karla and the wonderful things she has done for me and my dog gracee.
gracee is more excited to see her than she is to see me
she has always been there for gracee even for last minute calls
she has taken care of my sweet girl for almost4 years now and i would not let gracee go with anyone besides her
she is caring, punctual, and very enthusiastic about her job
you should give her a try  it s worth every penny to know that you pet is in great hands with wunderbar pet sitting
worst service i ve ever experienced
i wish there was something good to say about the business, but unfortunately, there is nt.
1  service and manners were nonexistent.
2  the employees constantly talk down to customers and are very argumentative for the sake of being argumentative.
to both myself and customers 3  i have never experienced so much rudeness coming from a business.
4  the business is very unorganized.
the invoice is not detailed, so it is difficult to see what you are paying for.
i d recommend to save your time and energy and find another greek store.
exile is the best
exile is the longest lasting and most authentic punk store in richmond
i have been shopping there for over six years now.
the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful and the owner, mimmy, is an absolute angel.
the mark up is minimal considering that the clothing is hard to find and often shipped for europe.
in addition, the clothing is of much better quality than the clothing from hot topic, which is made as cheaply as possible by people living in horrible conditions in asia.
exile is environmentally conscious and involved heavily in our community.
shop local at exile
overrated
buddakan inevitably attracts the majority of its guests simply because of its association with steven starr, but that does nt impress me.
the atmosphere alone deserves4 stars but, the food was not up to par with the price tag and the reputation the restaurant carries.
the server we had was knowledgeable but he was not as proper as he should have been, acting like he was talking to his friends rather than his customers.
the angry lobster was completely overpriced
80 for a dish that has about one small lobster tail and is full of filler vegetables
i would nt go there again.
alto delivers on all levels.
from the moment you enter the restaurant, you know you are some place special.
the service is impeccable, and the food is even better.
i highly recommend the four  course tasting menu, which gives you plenty of range and food to satisfy your appetite.
also, if you are into wine, alto has the depth of both region, varietal, and vintage to satisfy nearly any sommelier  or after9 pm, bring your own bottle for free ... no corking fee  .
while it s not cheap, alto will give you an experience you ll never forget.
the landlord is not nice nor helpful
i have lived in buckingham condominiums townhouse for2 years.
i love the location and the apartment
i m a single female and i feel safe coming home at night.
the maintenance people are awesome
and the exterminator is very nice, also.
yes, you still have a few bugs, but that s going to be anywhere you go
the only problem that i have experienced is the landlord.
she is a pure b
i know that s ugly ... but she wo nt help you out for anything ... sad story.
other than that, i would recommend living here.
the staff leaves a lot to be desired.
the front staff has seen quite a bit of turnover and changed from professional to rude.
a simple follow  up phone call with a woman quickly turned into a nightmare.
she may be the reason for all the change.
i sincerely wonder if the doctor has a clue about what is going on within his practice.
if he does know and approves of this behavior then it is a poor reflection on him.
sometimes it is not worth it to go through that kind of staff and their personal attitude to get to a doctor.
he was an okay doctor but not worth her.
www  wonderful wild wildernest inn
i would give the wildernest inn ten stars of five
atop spring mountain, from the decks of the west porch,  one can see forever  a scene of unparalleled beauty and grandeur.
i saw deer frequently, in fact a small herd were grazing near the lodge.
there were occasional bears on the deck in the morning.
and most correctly, us visitors did not mingle with the native wildlife.
it would have been more than one could bear
kathy and stewart, the proprietors were the epitome of perfection.
delightful, hospitable, superb, cozy and comfortable.
i hope to be back
junkie lube
really weird place, i was driving home from work thought i d stop in for an oil change and well, there are a few guys in jiffy lube uniforms sitting at the table drinking beers and shooting the breeze.
the neon lighting sign still said  on  yet some guy who seemed to be the oldest of the bunch, more like the drunkest of the bunch told me they d be open tomorrow.
i asked if a manager was on duty he told me he was.
wow
grey shirt  mark  of course with this type behavior he could have been wearing someon else s clothing .....
a friend and i recently took our 16 and 18 month olds here.
while there was nt too much available for their age  ball pit, bouncy area and a little padded pyramid to climb on , we went right when they opened at 10 am on a winter weekday and ended up being the only ones there, so we were given a little more liberty than we would have if others had been there.
it s not the classiest place, but it was cleaner than i expected and the staff was very friendly.
for 4 it was a nice break from the monotony of winter indoors with a toddler.
restored my faith in mechaincs.
i spent3 months going from shop to shop trying to get my ferrari to run and drive the way it should.
i was about to give up when i met jason and neal.
they took on the challenge of making my ferrari all i dreamed of and more.
the crew at the creative workshop went over and above the call of duty and gave me back a car i can drive anywhere and finally enjoy owning.
i can not say enough about this place.
they have restored my faith in mechanics.
do yourself a favor, call these guys first and enjoy driving your car again ..
a great vacation
we wanted to see the sun  and we also got much more
excellent chefs are in the kitchen preparing memorable breakfasts.
after a train ride over the mountains, we enjoyed hiking in the flower  filled wenatchee hills  in may  and a very interesting bike ride in a loop around the columbia river ... and then wine if we wanted it on the patio in the evening ....
this is a busy group of hosts they are also running a restaurant, which also must be wonderful  so just ask for what you need, and i m sure they will do their best to be hospitable.
omg
omg .. make sure to book a reservation, as this magical place is packed  in a nice way  i love that the owner walks around and cares how his customers feel about their food.
the waiters are like no other ...
my waiter was so excellent i gave him a 75  tip, and it was worht every penny ..
the food was finger licking the bowel fantastic ..
i just discovered her has a place right near my work  color me phat  if you are looking for a romatic place with the best food and service in the valley giovanni ristorante should be your number1 2 choice.
holly is truely the best hairstylist
i have lived in the utc la jolla area for many years, and i never new this salon was here until a friend reffered me to see holly here.
i was very pleased with my experience here.
all of the people were friendly and welcoming.
i got highlights, haircut, and a blowdry.
she did a great job
holly is very experienced and talented, and i could tell she new what she was doing right off the bat.
my hair looks amazing, and i get compliments all the time.
i deffenitly reccomend this salon and holly to anyone.
you will not be disappointed
outdated but not bad
so i really felt like this place was extremely outdated especially since the pictures make it look nice and modern.
it had listed that there was a hot breakfast but all this meant is that they added a waffle maker to the common continental affair at most cheap hotels.
the family suite was basically two rooms with a small opening between them which worked great for us because we were two families traveling together.
if you are in town and need that kind of space i say stay here but if you are looking for a little more upscale affair do nt let the pictures fool you and book somewhere else.
great, and probably the only west indian spot worth hitting up in nashville.
i was born and raised in toronto, which has a huge west indian  trinidadian, jamaican, etc  population.
so huge in fact, that toronto slang is influenced by and has jamaican references, and jamaican beef patties are staples in my high school cafeteria.
anyway, i was practically raised on this stuff, and being a connoisseur of west indian cuisine, jamaica way is a bit toned down to suit the american palette.
all you have to do to make it authentic jamaican food, is add a whole lot of pepper.
a lot.
the finest christmas trees i ve ever seen.
i felt like i was in heaven when i walked through the majestic fields of this particular farm.
the trees were in magnificent shape and the variety was astounding.
the owners were entertaining and gracious.
i especially liked the eco friendly atmosphere and the owner s love of all animals.
this is one of the best farms i have ever been too.
i would call it the taj mahal of the east coast
it put hair on my chest and thanks to the owner s advice i invested vanguard, got myself a woman like jerry, and became a republican.
thanks tussey mountain tree plantation
pho  nomenal
i have been eating pho for almost my entire life and i ve always gone to the pho places in south philly and off the boulevard and even the other one in chinatown, but when i tried this pho place, it blew the other pho houses away
all of the pho places taste the same to me, so what seperates one from the other is the service and the price.
the service here is incredible compared to the other places.
the only down fall of this pho house is the difficulty in finding parking in chinatown.
remember to bring cash since they do nt take debit or credit.
hope this helps
had a horrible experience with a manager here, rachel mcinnis, she was rude, inconsiderate and did not do the right thing for an item that was marked incorrectly ...
i m not interested in shopping in a place with people like her ... she refused to sell me the item at its marked price even after admitting they had made a mistake.
i normally do nt write reviews but seeing that i considered dillards a distinguished, upscale place to shop, this one wo nt be getting my business, nor my family s, nor my coworkers.
it s never ok to let a customer walk out unhappy, especially when they are right.
highly recommend
i work as a transformational life coach.
since this is an alternative therapy i always refer clients to a lisenced therapist when i feel that is appropriate.
i found her through a colleague one day when one of my clients was in the midst of a panic attack and needed professional help that i am not qualified to provide.
little did i know that i would soon be needing her help as well
she guided me through a very difficult period dealing with a family member s suicide, coupled with elder abuse.
i found her to be extremely solid, kind, compassionate, and intuitive as well.
i would recommend her highly
they wo nt have a second chance from me.
first, let me state that although i live in nyc, i am not from nyc, i do nt care about baseball and i absolutely love boston to death  so beautiful, so clean, so awesome .
that said, i hated this restaurant.
the service was just about as good as i d get in nyc  that means it was poor  and the food was almost mediocre.
the decor left a lot to be desired and the posters telling me all the reasons 99 was great just served as an ironic contrast against the reality.
personally i recommend you take your money elsewhere
when i arrived at brickell honda on 6411, i was greeted and attended to by the sales manager, gustavo guerra, in a very friendly and professional manner.
i explained to him what i wanted and that i previously went to braman honda.
bramen honda was a bit of a hassle.
he told me  no problem, we will match the offer or do better.
mr. guerra gave me a better deal without any hassles nor any type of problems.
brickell honda has been the best buying experience in the world.
i urge all st. thomas the apostle parishioners and all of south florida residents to come see gus
excellent customer service
great, honest service
i took my 2001 nissan frontier in to fix a cracked manifold.
the dealer wanted  1300 to fix that and another  1500 to fix some other things.
eagle transmission determined that much of the work the dealer said needed to be done was unneccesary and what needed to be fixed was only  400
i was so impressed with the honesty and integrity of mike and everyone at eagle transmission
i dropped the truck off in the morning and it was ready that afternoon.
i have finally found a mechanic i trust
and it was great that they did not charge a service fee to diagnose the problem  an added bonus
dr. shady
kelly hit the nail on the head.
dr. shady  is a jerk.
after the way she spoke to me on my last visit, i will not be returning
good luck keeping business with that stuck up attitude dr. shady.
you have just lost mine.
the next time you feel like being condescending to someone, it is not going to be me
dr. shady is inexperienced and prideful.
she probably does not even have 10  of the knowledge that some of the other experienced vets do in this area.
i will be carefully researching vets before i take my dog someplace else.
beautifully written reviews doctor, but completely untrue.
poor experience
i did not have a good experience w  dr. ghassemlou.
during the session, he demanded to have my physical address, which i ve always kept private as i am enrolled in a witness protection program.
i believe he is correct in that he needs my physical address for legal reasons, however, he did not adequately explain this during our session.
i learned more about this doing my own research afterward.
i think he could ve done more to assuage my concerns by giving me concrete facts.
saying that i need to give him my address or else i have intimacy issues is not helpful.
it s pretty combative actually.
you ll love it
i have had my back fused in2 places.
i wish that i had nt done this.
with these fusions, chiropractric is nt as successful, but it still is very helpful.
even after my fusions, my back continued to hurt, but now it does nt hurt any more.
i would encourage anyone who is thinking of back surgery, to talk about different treatment options first with dr. de barros.
he really knows what he is talking about and will approach the different options fairly.
you can see different treatments that a surgeon ca nt see, so that you can have several treatment options before you decide what to do.
unbelievably huge experience for such a small salon
i have been to kim at cheveux for more than five years.
i can not tell you how often i am complimented on my hair  style and color
i regularly request kim s business cards as i am often stopped on the street and asked  who does your hair ... i love it
quaint, lovely, small salon with big personality.
i am made to feel special when i am in the chair and i have never had a less than amazing cut or color experience.
my hair has never felt this healthy, either.
i can not recommend this salon enough
thanks cheveux
my favorite in mclean
my family loves coming to endo sushi. they are very nice, it is never crowded, and the food is wonderful, very delicious and fresh
sometimes it is hard to get parking in the lot in front of the storefront, and it is on a one  way street, but the restaurant itself is never overcrowded.
if you can not park in the lot, then you can park in the shopping center s garage, and walk up to endo sushi.
the service is fast.
be sure to ring the little bell on your way out if you enjoyed your meal
it s by the door, on the hostess stand
horrible service
i got yelled at, literally yelled at because i asked if i could pick up my car5  10 minutes late.
i explained that i was already on my way and i would rush to get there as soon as i could because i needed my car for work at5 am, but the guy was arguing with me saying he was gon na lock the doors right at 530.
rude, unprofessional, just jerks.
seems like all they care about is the money and getting home on time, no care for the customers at all
missed a whole day of work because i am now carless.
i will neeeeeeeeeverrrr go to this place again.
superb arrangements
i used fancy flowers for my late husband s funeral flowers as they had been recommended to me.
i am so glad that i called in to see ana, she is a lovely girl who showed nothing but care and compassion towards me.
the flowers were all that i hoped they would be, i have attended several funerals of late unfortunately and the flowers i recieved from ana outshone them all.
she is so talented, the flowers were arranged superbly and delicately, it is so obvious to see the difference between someone fully trained and skilled compared to others.
thank you ana i hope to see you in the future under better circumstances.
great first experience.
i m 22, and my hairdresser was great  and not  old  like one of the reviews says   she really listened to what i wanted and gave me tons of tips on how to style my hair so i could get it to look the way i wanted it to.
she deep conditioned my hair and took the time to style it properly.
she recommended products but absolutely did nt pressure me to buy.
it s a cute place with a really friendly, laid  back atmosphere.
i would highly recommend it and will be going back for my next haircut.
oh
and students get 5 off, ca nt argue with that.
smoker s haven
yeah, this complex is not very good.
our bathroom fan, one electric outlet and2 leaky sinks have yet to be fixed.
both bathrooms look like they were flooded and the wood cabinets are thrashed at the bottom and they slapped some pieces of wood over to try to cover it up.
and nonsmokers beware
i think 90 percent of the tenants are smokers
if you do not smoke, do not move here.
our unit reeks of old cigarette smoke and it started to become apparent a few weeks after we moved in.
you can not walk5 feet without smelling that disgusting cigarette smoke and it blows right into the windows all day and all night.
great sanwiches, great prices
i used to go here almost every day since i work in the neighbourhood and loved their turkey and meatball sandwiches.
chicken salad salad is great too.
best of all, the staff is quick on their feet and even with long lines, usually serve you in5 minutes or less.
for the quality, the prices  4  6  have to be the best in town.
the staff get to know regulars and do their job very well.
tourists like the other reviewer might not appreciate their efficiency or quality, but i certainly do.
this is nt a tgif or cafe, it s a lunch sandwich place and a good one at that.
rate a church
might as well just hotpot the curb and rate the traffic light.
it s a bloody church, for chrisssake
big, grey and imposing.
go there on christian holidays for a bit of churchy grandure.
the pastor at this church is cool, i met him after some holiday service.
he had a robe that was made back in the 60s.
god was pleased with that one
it s historical for sf, so when your aunte comes for a visit, take her there.
great for the kiddies  they love the labyrinth  do nt forget to tell em it s really a  pagen  thing  .
stop by at least once or you ll go to heck
ok but just becuse we where on a tight budget.
me and my dad where in nj for a kc chiefs  my home team  vs the ny jets and for game4 of the world series.
i m a red sox fan so i was glad that the phillies won.
the knights inn was small very small. i mean1 room in every room  it was cozy a little and a small tv.
i mean a2 day stay was a ok stay even tho the manager looked like he was chineze and that we only slept and went out from8 to7 to see new york.
but sice we almost just slept there i ca nt give that good of a review
it was a saturday and my spring was broken ...
i googled garage door repair in woodinville and found ndi  johnette answered the phone and was oh  so pleasant and helpful
she sort of appologized for dan taking the day off to go skiing  but he could do the repair on sunday
i said great and dan arrived on time at 10 am to make the repair.
i enjoyed speaking with dan, and learning more about how the springs are sized for these doors.
the repair went quickly and the price was extremely fair.
i would highly recommend ndi  and will spread the word to my neighbors.
thanks dan and johnette for your responsiveness and professional service.
roger m., woodinville
i would nt send my dogs there.
i had a conversation with the woman running this place in april 2010.
she basically said if the children getting off the bus are nt paying to enter her building she was going to let them wander around the streets.
wow, really
with all the child predators out there, a busy road, cars speeding by ...... and you are going to let some4 5 year olds wonder around cause you re money hungry
real christian of you
whether they pay me or not, if their parents get into an accident, stuck in traffic, etc. the last thing i would do is let a child get raped because i was nt paid.
excellent service
i could easily go to nordstrom for my designer jeans and pay the same price, but i go to the garment district for their service.
previous reviewers said they were pushy and i can understand that, but i find the staff more helpful than anything else.
tiffany is fabulous
i came in for alterations  free, by the way  and told her about a stain i had on my new leather purse.
she immediately went to the back, brought out leather cleaner and cleaned my purse on the spot.
i did nt even buy the bag there
huge selection and, great suggestions from the staff and they refer you to reliable places if they do nt have what you need.
we were expecting a great experience, when we recieved a friendly greeting by the hosts.
the atmosphere was nice and very clean.
the menu had plenty of options even for picky eaters.
the service was ok, our waitress kept forgetting our drinks even though we reminded her several times.
to start we tried the guacamole and salsa verde, it was completly flavorless.
we should have left then.
we orderd our meals anyway, chimichangas, jalapeno borritos, and quesadillas.
everything was bland, completely void of any spice or flavor.
we have never had mexican food this bad, it was just simply gross.
hopefully they spice things up or they wo nt be in business long.
i recommend la hacienda
might try again
pros   jill, the owner, is very nice and really cares about her feedback  pretty nice atmosphere  great dessert  not your typical veggie selection, i like
do nt know where else you can find purple hull peas and some of the other sides.
cons   server was nt very pleasant  pretty small portion on the blackened catfish  overcooked food  time, took about 25 minutes from ordering to eating.
half the tables and bar were empty by this point.
other thoughts  will try this place again.
there must be a reason so many people like it there.
their club sandwich looks tasty, maybe that ll change my mind .... and a different server.
very professional  very helpful
the people at fidelity leasing were very friendly and helpful.
i was looking for a car but did not really know what i wanted and they were very helpful and took the time to first figure out what my needs were and showing me various options to meet those needs.
they seemed more interested in helping me find the right car rather then just make a sale.
my experience with them was great  low stress, very helpful and very personal.
after finding the car i wanted they took the time to go over each step and making it as painless as possible.
from start to finish they were top notch.
i would highly recommend calling these people up for your next car.
this insurance co. is a joke
they have absolutely no communication skills whatsoever.
if you do nt mind being robbed, cheated or lied to then this is the company for you.
they will make every attempt to misinform and misrepresent themselves.
they make up excuses in hopes to confuse their policy holders with misinformation.
as an example they took payment for5 out of6 monthly plan premiums for a yearly policy and cancelled the contract for the remainder of the policy for reasons they stated was not receiving information on other licensed drivers in the household
i personally provided the request on four separate occasions and they claim there is a glitch in their systems
ifa is an acronym for i m a fking asshe
fantastic service
i have been here a few times for oil changes and just got my tires, alignment and state inspection done yesterday.
i shopped it around and they were extremely competitive in pricing and also added nitrogen to my tires which should extend the life and get me better gas mileage.
it also came with free balance and rotation for the life of the tires
what made it perfect was that they offered transportation so that i would not have to wait there or take time off of work to go back and forth or try to find a ride.
great service, great pricing and super convenient
i also did not feel like they tried to sell me a bunch of services that i did not need.
love my home at creekside
i moved to creekside apartments in august 2008 with a6  month lease and have just extended it for another 13 months
the management from julie and janice to the work staff, esp. edwin, are just wonderful.
they have been extremely helpful whenever i have asked for help.
although the apartments are facing stokes street and close to the bascom light rail, the location is surprisingly quiet.
i have never had any problems with loud neighbors or concerns about safety.
the apartments are within walking distance to trader joe s, whole foods, and other stores.
the well  equipped, clean gym is a plus
great place to live if you work in and around downtown san jose
i interviewed several contractors for a kitchen remodel.
liberty construction shows up and it s two guys ... all i get is 100  sales pitch  we re the best ... we re number 50 so we must be doing something right ... look at all these certificates that say we re great .
not once did i feel listened to like they actually cared about what i wanted, all they were interested in was me signing a contract right then and there.
very high pressured sales and with the reviews of many others bad service.
i m glad i trusted my gut and did nt get sucked into doing business with them.
find someone you trust that actually hears you and wants to do the job right.
do nt waste your time or money
i took my3 year old son here at the weekend and to be honest, apart from the shark walkway, i thought it was rubbish and overpriced.
even taking into account the fact that my3 year old wanted to run most of the way round, it took us just over one hour start to finish.
if you have been to the london aquarium i would not even bother with this.
if you are really desperate for something to pass the time and are willing to shell out the best part of l 30 for2 two people then go for it.
for some reason it will not let me rate it one star  it is not rated5 by me
cranmore dental and implant clinic  i could not recommend dr david nelson enough.
i had a severe phobia of attending the dentist until i met and was treated by dr nelson.
he instantaneously put me at ease and his ongoing treatments have been absolutely pain free.
my previous apprehension has been dismissed and i no longer have a sinking feeling when my next appointment is due
in addition to the core treatment, dr nelson has impressed me further with his concern and interest in the well  being of his patients  his dental work underpinned by a strong duty of care to every patient.
he is always prepared to go the extra mile to ensure that any patient discomfort is dealt with immediately
pam gillies
best salsa  hehehe
after my trees were cleaned up, they gave me a jar of salsa.
the owner warned me that it was the best salsa i would ever had, and he was right.
no joke
i hate to say check them out just for the salsa, but james, i need another jar badly  all kidding aside, they are a very good company, i have a hard time giving any service biz a5 star review but they came close.
very affordable  do nt call it cheap  and their trimmers were quick and courteous when i got home from work.
and the salsa, be sure to ask for a jar and have plenty of chips around, you will need them .....
dr. mann killed our pet
yea, dr. mann ai nt so great.
we took our beloved kitty to him and it came back dead.
we live in the subdivision around the corner and after it happened and we brought it up at some neighborhood gatherings we discovered that several people from this neighborhood alone had pets go to dr. mann for surgical procedures and came back dead.
if you take him here for shots, no big deal but i would never let this man apply anesthetic to my pet ever again.
oh, they also charged me for the procedure   250  and had the audacity to charge me a  25  disposal  fee.
they actually itemized it as a disposal fee.
avoid at all costs.
one of the worst places
this place and its sister store peking garden are the worst places to order from.
the food was horrible not cooked like it should be, they got the order wrong on a number of occasions, and once forgot about my order.
i had to call back up there two hours later and the lady  who claimed to be a manager  said my food was on the way, and she did nt offer to compensate me in any kind of way.
i waited another 30 mins before receiving my food and it was cold.
in my opinon this place should be shut down by the health inspector, and anyone who is satisfied with there service and food has never eaten at a real asian restaurant.
gone downhill since change in ownership
sigh.
i used to love this place.
but now that they are part of a chain, service has slipped.
i am waiting longer at bna for my pickups and last time i parked with them, they lost my car key.
lucky i had a spare with me
to date they have not made good by either finding the key or paying for a new one.
these new car keys are expensive to copy, you ca nt just go to walmart.
go to the website for coupons and join the club  you can get free parking.
however, with bna offering one day of free parking due to construction of the new rental car facility, it may be cheaper to park at bna.
wife and i attempted to adopt a dog and was nothing but frustrating.
we arrived sunday at about 230 and found a do we really liked.
we were told that we could nt today because they were closing soon.
i called the next morning to let then know my wife would be driving in.
they gave me the run around and missing paperwork only to call back to tell me someone else wanted her and i would need to come in and put down a deposit.
i work2 hours away but offered my card over the phone.
they refused.
terrible communication as well.
at one point they told me the dog had been fixed, the next day it had nt.
huge ammount of time wasted time and elevated blood pressure.
college is a joke and the salon is a joke
went to the school here over priced
you do not learn the things you were promised.
you have to bring in your own models and they have to pay for you to use them if you do nt then you can graduate
going back after graduating you r told you get a discount on services nope you do nt.
staff is under educated.
going there you learn the school does not care about the services given just about the money.
over priced for students to learn
beware of the nail program you are not taught to use a nail drill at all you learn the old fashioned way of doing nails you will not be able to do well in a salon
beware
you can fool people
this store is proof that you can fool people with good advertising.
they convince lots of people that they are a great store, when in fact they are a very average place at best, they are just another big box store like the others.
they offer sales that are nt really sales, mislabeled items that make the item sound like a good deal when it is nt, a bad attitude about return items, and on and on.
with higher than average prices to boot
so do nt get taken in, keep your eyes open if you choose to shop here.
on the other hand, the richmond ukrops chain is known for its charity work, its community action, and its interest in the public welfare.
never again
do nt go here unless you want to sit, order, eat and be asked to leave all in a matter of 20 minutes.
you wo nt even have time to read the entire menu before being asked to order and if you ask for more time your server will wait at the table.
this is the only place i have ever eaten and been told to leave because other people were waiting.
i was told to take my coffee to go if i wanted to finish it.
oh, and their liquor license was expired so no bloody mary or mimosas.
plus the drinks are self service, have fun trying to negotiate the small cafeteria space to get your coffee, juice or water.
go next door to the ball square cafe instead.
i guess you get what you pay for.
i tried to stay here for a few nights with my girlfriend, so we asked for a single queen bed.
we got there, and we were treated to the free  upgrade  of a room with two double beds.
since they consider this an upgrade, they let their other rooms fill up and would not change our room.
then we got put in a room with a huge gap under the door .... right next to the ice machine.
we could hear every single thing that happened outside like it was inside our room.
when i finally found someone at the desk who could speak english, they moved our room, but we still did not receive the single queen we had  reserved
i was thoroughly impressed
i had a problem with the tile in my bathroom coming apart.
i called a few different businesses in the area to get estimates, they were nt the cheapest i found but very reasonable.
the best part is i got my whole bathroom remodeled for about the same price the other compans were quoting just to fix the shower tile and fixtures.
they had the work done in about half the time quoted which made me and my wife extremely happy.
we have had nothing but compliments on our bathroom when guest come over  who would have guessed that one
very nice work and friendly guys too.
best money i ve spent on remodeling ever.
i highly recommend any one considering home repair to give these guys a call.
new training centre is excellent
the award dance centre has moved from its holderness road site to a new complex on chamberlain road hull.
the new centre has4 studios planned and now boasts the largest single dance floor area in kingston upon hull.
the classes cover all age and skill ranges, with ballroom, latin, sequence, street, disco, line dancing, ballet, tap  jazz.
we have attended a ward dance centre for over a year and really enjoy the friendly and welcoming way we are taught ballroom and latin as well as the fun filled social dance evening held every saturday evening ....
it is not really possible to score this school too highly, we would give it 12 out of 10 and5 stars across the board steve  anne
i purchased a2  year old certified preowned bmw from this dealership.
the night i drove back home, i found that the rear window has some leakage.
you can hear the wind while driving on highway.
very likely it needs a new window seal .
i admit that i should have paid attention to this kind of little things while test drive.
but this is a certified car from a dealer.
so i brought the car back the second day.
they told me that this is not under warranty and want to charge me  175 just to diagnose the problem
who knows how much they want me to pay to fix this thing.
i walked away.
so my advice is that never trust this dealer.
stay away as far as possible.
perfect practice
after i had chosen the fountain dental practice they provided a slick and professional service from start to finish.
everyone was friendly from the receptionist to the surgeon herself, putting me at my ease and explaining the whole process, both initially and then as we went along.
surgery visit timings were always made to suit me and not them and they gave me the feeling that i mattered and was important to them.
the surgery itself is slick, modern and very relaxed and i always felt that i was in capable hands.
my dental surgeon, dr. lucy nichols is clearly a dental perfectionist and clearly proud both of the work she does and the reputation she has established.
everyone was so helpful that i can not wait to go back .....
peter
wonderful service for large group
i had my wedding luncheon at this bj s restaurant, and it was one of the best choices that i made.
it was a great deal  we paid a certain amount per person, and my husband and i chose4 types of pizza and the servers brought out as much as we wanted.
we were also served salad and soda.
we had a large party, about fifty people or so, and yet everything was served quickly and we all had a wonderful time.
even though we were only supposed to have those specific types of pizza, when guests asked for a different type, it was brought out with no charge to us
i really appreciate bj s for making that special day even better with their wonderful food and service.
wonderful
i went to ohm after reading some of the reviews.
i go to school in the area and usually wait until i go home to get my hair cut.
i decided it was time to grow up and made an appointment.
sierra was my stylist and i love what she did.
i have wavy hair and she cut to my hair style.
it was the first time i had left a salon with my hair curly.
usually they blow dry it out and i have to wait until i wash it to see what it will look like in its natural state.
but she did a fabulous job letting me know what she was doing at all times and styled my hair in a way i could do it at home.
it was nt completly impossible
i am definitely going back
after recently relocating to south bend, we were looking for a delicious, fun, yet elegant establishment for new year s eve dinner.
we were disappointed with this holiday dinner due to the overall flavor and price of the meal, and accessibility to the jazz club.
the meal was extremely overpriced and lacked flavor, especially for being a special nye menu.
the limited menu had few appetizing options and the nye special packages were way overpriced.
after our meal, our server found us a table in the jazz club where we were informed it would be another  10  person to stay and listen to the band, despite the fact we had just finished a dinner there and were intending to enjoy their drink list.
this was a less than impressive experience at trio s.
run for the hills ... you ll be much better off
one night was too much.
first room had used tissues next to the bed and i requested it be rectified.
i was then moved to another room around the back where the room was dirty, the shower was dirty with other people s hair in it, the toilet seat was peeling and rough and the bathroom was full of mould.
i called reception to ask if they knew the state the room was in and was told  this is a days inn, not the hilton  and the receptionist then hung up on me.
to warn you to stay away from this place just is nt enough.
there was not one ounce of caring involved and anyone i can warn about the complete lack of service will be warned.
grocery and daily needs store
before using fusionretail before installing fusionretail store was running on a dos based software.
we were having a major problem in maintaining cash.
being a grocery shop, maintaining 5000 different products was a challenging job.
managing pos counter without barcoding was really a tough time.
how fusionretail has overcome these issues
fusionretail helps us to maintain the store in an organised way.
usage of product barcodes and smooth maintenance of inventory with proper recording of transactions like sale, purchase and returns was never easy before.
how long does it take to train new people at work
billing takes 15 minutes and back office jobs takes1 day s training how fast your support queries get answered
over telephone, immediate.
on call, it takes a day to get our issues resolved.
ca nt wait to go back
this is by far the best bb that we have ever stayed at
we were in santa fe for a special event and our hosts rented out the el paradero for all their guests to stay at.
we could not have been more welcomed, more comfortable or more well fed.
the weekend was perfect in every way, in large part to sue and her great staff.
everyone was so friendly and really went out of their way to make sure everything went well.
we can not wait to go back to santa fe and to this great bb ... especially my4 year old, who made friends with ms. sue and all the ladies, and has talked about them since we left
we would highly recommend the el paradero on your next trip to santa fe
disatisfied customer, i went through kitchen aid and used one of their recommended vendors.
ae came out, charged  129 fee just to walk in the door.
i needed a part for my appliance, the cost was very high so i said never mind, paid the fee and called a local business for a second quote.
the second vendor charged  55  less than half of what ae charges  to come and applied that to the price of the repair service  which ae does not .
their quote came in at half the price of ae for the same work and same part.
seems to me like ae charges way more than necessary
very disappointed in kitchen aid as well, i thought that they prescreened their vendors for price and quality of work, obviously they do not
lovely nails on cayuga st. in lewiston, ny
first let me start out by saying, that i have had very nice pedicures at lovely nails on military road.
i was very excited that a salon was opening in lewiston, as i live in youngstown.
i was in two weeks ago and had the worst pedicure that i have had in my life.
there were four of us and i was taken first by a gentleman.
i put my foot in the water and it was cool.
he did warm it up.
he also hurt my toes will pushing my cuticles back.
if the pedicure lasted 20 mins., that was a stretch.
the other ladies had a similar experience, both had nail polish on a couple of toes.
none of us will be using their services again, which is a shame.
good service  limited results
andrew was helpful and knowledgeable about acupuncture re  infertility.
he was willing to talk to me about my specific issues and develop a plan of action.
the office is shared with a foot doctor and it s very sterile and medical feeling, which i liked.
the down side was that sometimes there was a lot of noise in the hallway from other patients  doctors.
i worked with andrew for2 months and did acupuncture and herbs.
the sessions were nice and i felt relaxed after them but did not notice any changes with my cycles.
i know it can take a while for results and did nt expect a miracle, but after2 months i felt like it was not entirely worth the cost  time.
i am also a little suspicious of all these glowing reviews ...
friendly, clean and excellent location
the staff was very helpful, and gave us good advice on day and night time activities.
common room was comfortable and clean, very good room to read or relax.
a great breakfast which was included every morning until 930 am  yummy fresh parisian croissants.
comfortable and clean beds, a bit noisy when people were coming in late from a night out, but we did nt mind too much as we were also just coming in from a night out
the location is really stellar
it is next to gare du nord and a five minute walk to sacre coeur which is excellent for shopping.
it is close to bus lines for opera plaza, galleries lafayette, and the famous flea market.
we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay at the vintage hostel again.
just autos thank you
was fast and easy, just had our car returned this morning, i would recommend these mobile mechanics for sure.
they certainly know what they are doing.
the mechanic came to our place and sorted out our car s problems, he explained the problem and was very up front and honest, it was towed to the workshop as the gearbox was not working  he explained it better .
they phoned the same day, confirmed it was the gearbox quoted me the job, i gave the go ahead.
now my car s gears and brakes have never run so well ... ever it s like driving a new car.
so yes, i would nt hesitate in recommending the team at just autos for easy professional car repairs, thank you just autos for your help.
i stopped in today  yards brewery.
i must say, i was impressed with the size of the bar area and lounge,  i liked that you could see the brewery right thru the glass
i had a sampler of ipa, brawler, love stout  esa.
all were awesome,  i had a dogwood grilled cheese which was enjoyable with the fine beers.
after my sampler  sandwich, i asked for a pint of there nitrogen love stout, i must say i was impressed, with the great taste  i am a guiness lover so coming from me, i think this is better, it s less dry  smoother
if you are in philly you have to come check this place out
the only negative i have abou this place is the parking
i left with a case of brawler
oil change disaster
my wife had taken her 07 ford fusion in for a routine oil change.
a couple days after the oil change, the engine ran rough, the low oil pressure light would come on sporadically, and the engine would whir loudly.
turns out the engine had no oil, and when oil was put it, it would just run out of the filter.
there could have  hopefully does nt have  major damage to the engine.
all of this started after their oil change.
once they realized their mistake they sent a mechanic and tow truck to my wife s work and towed it back to fix it.
i would not recommend this shop for anything, not even something as simple as an oil change.
plus they will overcharge you for just about everything, and smile while doing it.
liars, negative stars
took my cruze in twice for poor fuel economy.
the first time they claimed to get reasonable mpg.
however, they would never drive the car with me in it to prove their findings.
i wonder if they were going down a hill
they told me to bring it back after 5000 miles.
i brought it back with 9000 miles.
they  finished  the work and told me the car was ready.
i found out they did not even drive the car, stated they looked at it before.
they still would not drive the car with me to show their mpg number.
they also claimed not to see anything wrong with the blower fan  a seperate issue , but when i drove the car home i had the same symptoms.
i will never purchace another vehicle from vic canever.
great job
i want to say that mike did a great job for our family in our time of need.
both my grandparents passed away4 months apart and mike was very understanding.
it was a very trying time for my family and myself yet mike took the time to greet each and every one one of us.
he is very professional in his position as a director and yet he still made time to be compassionate for what we were all going through.
i m sure it s not every day that a funeral director sees the same family in such a short time.
my grandfather passed away silently in his sleep, and my grandmother passed away after a short struggle with cancer.
both my grandparents looked as natural as could be expected.
thank you mike for all your help professionally and personally.
the peterson family
poor service
if you like the drama described in popular sitcom  seinfeld , you will see it here.
we signed our name in about 600 pm.
there were3 names before us.
the greeter said there was about 15 minutes waiting.
however, we waited and waited and in the mean time, saw4 groups of people simply just paraded in without signing there names.
this sign in policy is posted by the restaurant  no reservation, sign your name here .
i had to ask the greeter, he explained his reasons with broken english.
i could not understand any his reasons.
i could only take it as they would seat the people they know first.
my conclusion is that you should only go there if you want to wait a least an hour and see all kinds other people being seated before you.
instructor never showed up
january 15th  we were signed up for saturday s2 pm class  beginning yoga with brittany.
we even arrived 10 minutes early as the website suggests.
the instructor did not show up
we waited until 225 pm and then left.
there were2 in our group, and a 3rd person was also in the parking lot waiting for this class.
well, not much i can say except i m very disappointed with this experience.
this was our first visit to your studio.
in today s instant world, there s no reason for the instructor not to even have given us a phone call or email if she was going to be late.
as a yoga studio, i m sure you re all aware that all actions generate karma.
and sometimes karma can manifest itself on a bad review on google.
finest
really
i beg to differ.
this place is marginal at best.
not very welcoming and focused mostly on keeping little kids entertained.
i was not impressed, and quite frustrated at their lack of rating for their courses.
i understand not wanting to put labels like 5.10 on an indoor course, because yes, it is not the same, but some clear understanding of the difficulty of one course to another is nice when you are an intermediate climber looking to improve.
i do nt want to waste my time on routes set for children, but i do nt want to take on something i ca nt handle just to strain myself to exhaustion.
rate the routes, with understandable markings and a more detailed system than easy, moderate, and hard.
again, a great outing for the kids, a frustration for an out of town climber.
best djs in town
wow
these guys were the best.
they were thorough, high class, and went above and beyond.
we never had to worry about a thing, and they led the way the whole time.
they asked us things that we would have never have thought of, and took extra time to meet with us when we needed it before the wedding.
having a team was the best because they kept the flow of the wedding going the whole time
they may look young but do nt let that fool you, as their knowledge of music far surpassed what we expected.
i am a music junkie that grew up in the 80s, and my dad worked for a record label in the 1960s.
so we did nt expect them to even know some of the requests that we asked that night.
they just really know their stuff
never fear going to the dentist again
i m 61 years old and have dental problems my entire life.
by the age of 24 i stopped going to the dentist.
my fear and discomfort from dental work scared me
it took all the courage i could muster to make an appointment.
at the front door of his office, i nearly turned around.
i considered just leaving after going inside and nearly did.
doctor gonzales and his entire staff are the most professional people i have ever dealt with.
they made me feel confident in what they would do, and treated me like a member of their own family.
i never felt pain or discomfort.
the ability to smile and eat again can only be described as a whole new lease on life.
thank you doctor gonzales, doctor stout, eva marie and the entire staff

horrible service and food
not only is this place too expensive for what it is, it s horrible
in the past, i got a steak and there was more fat and rough pieces than there was good steak  and this was the sirloin  , the sides were drenched with butter and the salad was a little on the brown side.
today we went for a party  during lunch, so the place was empty  with about 25 other people.
it took over 1.5 hours for our food to come out and by that time my8 month old had it
does it seriously take that long for a soup and salad
i was a waitress for years and a key rule is to serve customers with small children before others, as i was the last to get my food.
i would not recommend having a party here or even going here.
texas roadhouse is way better
spay and neuter service.
i have no doubt that the rescue is wonderful.
but i had my cat spayed through their reduced  free spay and neuter program and the vet they sent us to was first of all a hour and a half away, and4 days later we had to bring them to our normal vet because the vets at the place in wisconsin did a crappy job and they got infections.
my vet even said it was not my fault it was the vet that did the surgery, so i would not recommend getting that program unless you have an extra hundred dollars or so for antibiotics and a vet visit.
you d think they would do a good job but they do nt care unless they are getting paid full price.
which is so dumb.
not to mention the fact that they gave us our cats back not even 30 minutes after they were out from surgery.
billing issues ...
i had a routine surgery for an ingrown toenail.
my insurance company, blue cross  blue shield paid the fees and everything was fine.
then i got a bill for  483.00.
the doctor s office said that payments had been  reversed .
blue cross has no record of aa reversal.
the office refused my requests to see what they got from bc  bs.
they eventually turned it over to a collection agency and now will not even discuss the matter.
i eventually decided to just pay the balance even though the doctor has already been paid, but now the collection agency is trying to say another reversal of  160.00 has come through.
it was an ingrown toenail.
how much could it possibly cost
not only am i being bilked for money i do not owe, the office staff is rude to boot.
i think this office has some serious billing practice issues
we have been blessed to find elite flyers online and would not use anyone else to handle our postcards, posters, etc.
we were looking for a company with decent rates as our company was just getting started.
they have the best rates and great customer service.
on one order, we needed it rushed and shipped to a different state.
they did that with no problem.
i also appreciate their honesty.
i sent a graphic that would have been distorted if printed as it was.
they called and worked with me to fix it so that it would look perfect.
they recently surprised me a larger order.
i ordered 1000 postcards, we normally order 5000 or more.
because they had room to do 5000, they created the larger amount, and shipped them early.
i recommend this company to anyone and everyone that needs great work done at a reasonable rate
they have a customer for life in us
sheisters
i made the mistake of buying from these thieves.
i paid2 k cash for a truck with a blown motor.
their so called mechanic said the engine was good and  there is nothing mechanicly wrong with this truck .
well i think a blown engine falls under the catagory of mechanics right
anyway they jimmy rigged it so i could drive it home.
the next day i took it to2 auto shops and they both told me the same thing, engine is junk.
i called and got the same runaround on hold and noone calls you back.
from a moral standpoint, you guys are really gon na take 2,000 bucks from someone that needs that truck to work and support his family when you know it s just a piece of scrap metal
if it lasted1 month i could suck it up but1 day
grimy work you guys do.
buy your kids somethin nice with my2 k bucks.
best stationery store in bethesda
papeluna, a cute mom  pop custom printing and paper store, just opened a few days ago.
it is right on the hustle and bustle of wisconsin ave but some might miss it as it is nestled in between subway sandwiches and modell s.
i popped in after my afternoon pumpkin spice latte break at starbucks.
it s an adorable little store filled with lots of stationery goodness.
cards, wrapping paper, paper, and an area to sit down and talk with someone to design your own invitations or for whatever else your custom printing needs may be.
i gave the woman i spoke with today a  you ve been yelped   card to let her know that yelp may be a good tool for helping spreading the word about papeluna.
i ended up buying a birthday card and would probably come back for more.
printing, printing, copies, printing, copies, printing,

this company is overpriced for their services.
they pride themselves on being an event and team building company for corporate clients but you better believe they are going to mark you up on that feel good premise.
on a recent event quote that i had done, they came in thousands of dollars over their local competition.
the craziest part is that they are nt even based locally at the city i m in  they just have  teams  in areas through the country.
i ve spoken to vendors who are used by them who had nothing good to say about the company as well and in fact were afraid to quote events against them even though they openly admitted that they felt canadian outback was pricing their entertainment out of the market and doing more to hurt their business than help them.
be warned  they ll ltake you for everything they can.
believe me.
this is the premier university in virginia.
it is also the largest.
with a pizza hut, ihop,3 starbucks, chili s, panera, and chipotle on campus alone, vcu has some of the best eating options for students.

the rams, the vcu sports team, also made the ncaa final4 this year, too
vcu also offers high  rise living for students and professors, and the historic yet fixed  up houses in the fan are also available to students, professors, or even people wanting to live in a safe, viable community.
vcu is also minutes from downtown richmond, canal walk, carytown, stony point, short pump, and the vcu medical center.
it is the best university in virginia and continuously receives rave reviews every year.

orr s a nightmare
do nt go
my boyfriend and i were woken up in the middle of the night at our campsite by drunken kids who d arrived around 100 am and were drinking at the springs.
when we complained to the management  as we were instructed to do if there were any problems , nothing happened
then, the next morning, when we, among many other irate guests, asked to speak to the owner, he refused to do so.
not only that, but he told us, via his manager, that it was our responsibility to get up a second time in the middle of the night and call the night staff if the problem continued, even though his manager did nothing the first time to stop the kids.
orr is not relaxing, it s not a safe space, and the owner is awful.
to add insult to injury, he refused to refund our money.
do nt go
fhs is a good high school  c  o 1998
i enjoyed my time at franklin high school.
we had relatively good facilities at the time  decent science labs, with multiple hoods and access to good equipment  nice gymnasiums, and a well  funded music department  i was in the guitar ensemble .
now, of course, there s a new building, with presumably better facilities.
all to the good.
for those who care, a good proportion of the my class went on to4  year colleges, many of them ranked in the top 50 of us news.
if i remember, students went to dartmouth, u. penn, duke, bu, william and mary, vassar, howard, and carnegie mellon, among others.
many students went to rutgers, including their top  ranked pharmacy program.
the point is  fhs gives you the opportunity to make it to a good college, but you need to work hard.
absolutely the best little motel on the coast
i ve stayed at this fabulous little motel two years running, and i have to say it s one of the best lodging experiences i ve ever had on the coast ... and i m even comparing it to the big resorts i ve stayed at
a large group of my friends and i rent almost the whole motel every year for a weekend, and the experience and stay have always been five  star.
the rooms are so clean, the managers  owners are the nicest people, the place feels so homey, and the location and grounds are beautiful.
there s a restaurant nearby  walking distance  with a great breakfast, and a market across the street.
the motel is very well maintained, and the managers are so accomodating, it s kind of like visiting family each year
i honestly ca nt rave enough about this place ... it s really a hidden gem worth checking out
my favorite cuban cafe in orlando
i have been eating cuban for a long time, sandwiches mainly along with other dishes ..
i love cuban coffee, colada ... mmmm anyways i found this place and ca nt stop going there, i stop in at least once a week and anytime i m in the area for a cuban coffee or snack.
the place is chill and comfortable.
they do nt speak the best english but enough to get by.
they bake bread fresh daily, they do nt press their sandwiches which is the way i like it, and the meat is always fresh.
they have a great lunch special with your choice of meat, chicken, steak, or pork and rice and black beans and fried plantains.
and their breakfast is awesome
i can not describe how delicious the mango and cheese pastries and the omelets are to die for.
stop in and have a bite you wo nt regret it.
a slice of heaven in winter park off forsyth
highly recommended.
i have been going to warner family for a number of years and would highly recommend it to anyone.
i ve read some of the reviews below and would like to state that yes, like any other doctor s office there is sometimes a wait  depending on what other patients are being seen for  and some of the tests and procedures that are ran can be costly  just like they would be for any other medical tests elsewhere if you do not have insurance  ...
i have seen several of the providers from the office and have not once been shown anything but care and consideration.
i ca nt speak for them but any tests or appointments they recommend are probably in the best interests of us  the patient  and you have the ability to decline anything that they suggest to you.
i personally have had wonderful service and if you re truely looking for a family practice ... warner family is the place for you.
not what i expected
we read the good reviews before going and had high hopes .. but to our dismay it did nt turn out that way
it took over 40 mins to be taken to our table, once there it took another 20 mins to get our orders and a further 45 mins till our starters landed on our table.
very frustrating for a restaurant that has1 rosette and is supposedly renowned for the service ... hmm there was no canapes or amuse to keep us occupied, once we complained about the wait they took us something to nibble on but that took us getting out our chairs and wondering round to do that and it was impossible to get anyone s attention.
scallops were overcooked and the foie gras was cold but the rest of the food was lovely.
on top of that though they tried to charge us service charge just to rub it it ....
would nt go back as there are a lot of places a lot better and cheaper.
nice selection, very clean, friendly staff
hot iron has become a favorite of our family.
everyone can get the signature dish with ingredients and spices that they want and have the fun of watching it cook.
the staff are very friendly and conscientious.
they always ask if you have meat in your dish,  for vegetarians like me , they scrub an area of the grill and use separate utensils to cook.
they do nt just dump your ingredients on and cook either, but carefully separate meat to the hotter parts of the grill and still manage to keep the veggies from turning to mush.
the selection of meats, veggies and sauces is awesome too
every time we go they seem to have a different ingredient or two which keeps things interesting.
meats are kept very cold, seafood smells fresh and the serving bar is very clean.
prices are reasonable,  kid s meals are around 4.99  and wednesdays they have discount dinner prices, i believe.
great cookies, cakes, and customer service
it was my birthday and i had a last minute idea to have a bakery cake instead of one premade in a convenience store, but the problem was it was the day before valentine s and when many bakeries turned me down for a plain vanilla rectangle cake, fiona stepped up to the plate and was able to make a fantastic beautiful cake.
not only did it taste wonderful, but the texture was unbelievable, the frosting was nt overly sweet to over power the cake, and the cake itself was just amazingly soft, and fluffy, and just perfect overall.
although i ll have to drive a little out of my way to go there, i ll gladly do it knowing that since she s been astounding to me once before that she ll always be that way
also she has a really great website
and we bought a few cookies there too, they were fantastic as well
she deserves many5 star reviews
food craving gone and weight loss at acupuncture doctor
i am a college student.
before treatment, my food cravings were  out of control  which caused me to be stressed out.
i experienced a definite decrease in food craving  about 50   and decrease in stress after the 1st treatment.
i actually loss4 pounds after my 1st treatment and2 pounds after my 2nd treatment.
i was amazed.
i am now more at peace and my food craving is about 99  gone after only3 treatments.
before coming to acupuncture doctor i was a big baby about needles and only came because my boyfriend s aunt recommended it.
it hurt very little, felt more like pressure than pain.
what i like most about dr. liau is that she is very caring.
she talks to you at each appointment.
i can tell she really cares and wants to help.
i am so glad to have found dr. liau.
now i feel more confident wearing my bathing suit in the summer.
an asset to richmond
for a long time, one big source of entertainment missing from the richmond city limits was a first  run multiplex.
bowtie has filled that role nicely.
the theatre is in an old brick warehouse, which is a block away from the flying squirrels stadium.
the owners of bowtie manged to add something new while preserving what was already there.
the theatre has greatly improved the surrounding neighborhood.
there s plenty of parking, and i ve never had an issue with audience members who wo nt stop talking or answering their cellphones.
best of all, there are no ads
just previews and the main feature.
expect to pay full price, and the theatres themselves are on the small side.
but if you like going to the movies, you should love bowtie.
the mangers also play a classic movies on sundays, you can get a beer in the lobby, and repeat customers can get discounts if they have a member card.
a great cinema in a great location.
thank you, bowtie
craft wonderland with history
my first visit was so fun yesterday.
i could have stayed all day and not seen all the things.
i am doing origami jewelry and found exactly the right things for earrings and got many other ideas there too.
i bought a beginner s quilling set and like making the filigree forms you can make and add to other crafts.
the owner, jean, has been there 31 years
what a history.
she is a super sweet, lovable and well  informed woman with a great sense of humor.
i really enjoyed meeting her and happy to learn she comes from oklahoma and has the values of a solid no bs country girl.
this store is a real gem and has much to offer the serious crafter or the occasional crafter.
by the way, salmagundi  the store name  means something like smorgasbord  potpourri  motley  variety  mixed bag  miscellaneous assortment  mixture, a variety of many kinds of things.
great name for a great store

the 2010 genesis is grrrrrrrreeeaaat
i am a proud owner of a brand new 2010 hyundai genesis.
i have never seen this car before until this lady at wal mart had it and she told me she got it here and that everyone was so nice to her.
i asked her who she worked with and she just told me ti was the sales manager.
i took the weekend off and came in and asked for the manager who is jeff and he remembered her right away even remembered her dog, i was a bit shocked that someone would pay that close attention.
we got to talking and he got me set up and i test drove with craig and i fell head over heels for this car all i kept saying,  was i got ta have it
i thouhgt it would be out of my price range but they really worked with me and now i could nt be happier.
jeff and craig are really good at what they do and know exactly how to treat a customer.
definitely go see them
bait and switch, untrained workers
called the bonanza store2 weeks ago, before i ripped out 350 sq ft of ceramic tile ... was told i would need a  dual head concrete grinder  to remove thinset and make a nice  finished  look  ready for concrete stain .
was quoted  55 all inclusive of grinder inserts, etc.
no problem, sounded like it s done every day.
will look beautiful.
got the tile ripped out, call today, now all the sudden this grinder wo nt leave a finished look and it s  125 plus around  75 for the inserts.
i can rent another machine for like  60 that will give it a finished look.
so from  55 to  260
are they serious
i feel like they did nt tell me the pitfalls before i pulled out this tile and now that i have no other options they want5 times the price
either these people do nt know anything about what they are renting, or worse  they are bait and switching.
one suspects that earlier reviewer works for another laundry.
outside of parking being at a premium, especially on discount days, the laundry tub is not filthy and it s no smaller than any of a dozen laundromats i ve been in.
yes, there are bigger, but bigger is nt necessarily better.
i availed myself of the wash n fold service, taking just about a year s worth of dirty clothes in and getting back neatly folded, clean clothes in clear plastic bags  i d originally brought them in, in six large yellow garbage bags .
the cost was certainly reasonable and i will continue my patronage of the laundry tub in the future.
did nt hurt any that they knew my name by my second visit and greeted me warmly then and on my third visit.
whereas my answer to the question  where do you get your laundry done   used to be,  at the checkout line at walmart,  i can honestly say the answer now is,  at the laundry tub.
thank you
i recently took a rescue puppy to this clinic and i was shocked at how well romeo and my family was treated.
they worked around the clock to ensure that my puppy life was saved.
we have to leave him at the vet for3 days and i was told to call for check ups as often as i wished that no matter how many times i called i would not annoy them.
lol they where super friendly towards us and treated us like people not walking bags of cash.
in this day it s rare to find such wonderful people who care, not the kind of want to make cash.
i would strongly suggest you give them the chance to prove to you that not all people in this world are evil
i will never go to another vet as long as i have animals.
i live nearly two hours away and yet i will still make the drive to see them
in fact i look forward to taking my animals to the vet simply because of how my animals and i are treated.
okay, here s the scoop.
i m a regular at the hh.
the food is excellent, the serivce is horrible.
i think they re still in the mindset from when it was only smokers sitting around and drinking ... not in any hurry.
in my experience the food has been excellent  for the most part .
however, the bartenders  waitresses definately need to be retrained  if they ever had any to begin with  and learn two things  only chat with customers when other customers are not impatiently waiting and to look around more often to see if people are waiting.
in some cases the result is because of understaffing, in some cases the staff just does nt care  know better.
they must also get something to keep take  out warm, so it s not room temperature at best when you get it home.
you just have to know what you re getting into when you go.
nice local pub, excellent food  especially wings , and do nt go if you have a limited amount of time.
trust the midas touch
i personally trust this midas store with all my vehicles, i have been going there for years  would never go anywhere else
the staff is very personable  actually care about the customers safety rather than taking there money.
this is however a very busy shop but there are appointments available  the staff up front will surely make sure you get back in a timely manner.
i look at some of these other comments  laugh because people think that the world revolves around them
like the girl with the fuse problem ...
midas has the most high tech equipment in town  i guarantee you if they told you it was electrical then in deed it s electrical
maybe you should understand how the world works  realize you are just like any other person  not put yourself on a pedestal.
i will continue going to dave at midas because he is one of the most honest business owners in this town
when having your car worked on you have to trust the mechanic  this midas is truly someone you can trust
we decided to try this place last night because we noticed that it had some interesting things on the menu aside from the usual rolls  live scallop sashimi, duck breast nigiri with foie gras, panko mussels  but none of these were particularly great or worth the sticker price.
additionally we tried the logan circle roll, spicy crab and tuna roll, and sweet potato tempura roll   15,  10, and  3.75 respectively .
the sweet potato tempura roll was actually a great surprise  cheap and delicious, the only thing we tried that i would say was well worth it and a great value  and i never get vegetarian rolls .
the other rolls were nt at all special, especially given their pricing.
the bottom line is that the food is nt great and is relatively high  priced.
the service is solicitous, the atmosphere is nice and mod except the out  of  place flat  screen tv playing football.
but i d go elsewhere unless the prices are cut.
it s just not worth it.
do nt expect sleep or courtesy
i was booked for2 nights at this hotel in oct 2007.
at 315 am on night 2, the fire alarm and strobe light activated in my room.
these are not household type alarms.
when they sound off, it is a true audio  visual experience.
i called the front desk and got no answer.
after checking for signs of fire or smoke and seeing none, i decided to just pack up and leave.
the desk agent actually argued with me, claiming that no such alarm had gone off  as if i would make that up  .
he finally admitted that only the4 ada room alarms had sounded, so only4 guests were effected  no big deal to him .
this little drip offered no apologies whatsoever, and even refused to give me the name of the manager until i pressed him for it3 times.
this hotel is adequate enough, but there is an obvious problem with the staff and management.
do not go there if you expect to sleep through the night.
poor service, lack of passion  do not go
i began seeing dr. romanick back in 2000 and have seen a significant decline in the quality of care, patient  doctor communication, and just the overall level of services.
the poor quality starts at the receptionist desk, where the staff is very impatient and lack the efficiency i once loved about the office.
it took them nearly two months to complete a simple task, and countless calls from my part due to their lack of response and passion  not that it s a requirement for the job, but it helps to at least pretend to be helpful .
also, i was promised to have my test results emailed to me, but it never happened, and after a few attempts to get dr. romanick on the phone to brief me on my condition, i finally gave up and went to a different doctor.
please do not go there if it s professional, friendly, diligent medical services you re looking for.
save yourself the trouble, money and time and visit a more caring facility  doctor.
the moving company is actualy based in brooklyn, but advertised all over ny  nj, including fort lee.
when the guys arrived 2 hours later than agreed  they told that you have to pay all the tolls they payed coming from brooklyn and extra  100 for them to drive back from your destination.
that was not in agreement eather, but they realy demand it.
and another  100 for wrapping the furniture.
so totalling  212 just for start before any work started.
guess what, was not in the initial agreement as well.
i was moving out from2 bdr apartment and it took for3 strong guys6 hours to load a track  from2 pm 8 pm .
the only reason i m giving3 stars instead of1 or2, i should admit, nothing was broken.
so i still can recomend them but prepare pay twice as much as they tell you initially.
one more thing, they do nt take any credit cards or checks.
you have to pay cash only before they start unloading track on your destination.
worst apartments ever
we lived here for2 years, the first year or so was okay.
then, the more power they gave to linda, the worse the place got.
we were always having our water shut off, there were always people having parties at the pool, even after it was supposed to be closed.
the pool was supposed to close at 10 and they would have people down there until 1145 yelling, playing music and do who  knows  what in the dark corners of the pool.
then, when we moved out, we cleaned the apartment top to bottom, they came back and tried to charge us for two cleaning fees  and we never got our deposit back  and past utilities  that were already paid, we have check numbers and records of this .
linda is the rudest person you will ever talk to and she sticks up for all of the trashy, rude people that live there, not the nice ones that actually give a crap about respecting others.
do not live here, you will regret it
the worst experience ever
i have worked with ted jurek at decor and you, and it started out as a decent experience.
he was referred to me by a friend, who did nt have the best experience with ted, but said that ted was able to make up for his lack of preparedness at the end.
i figure i would give this company a chance.
however, after giving a required  500.00  non refundable  deposit before seeing any plans or ideas, i was sorry i did.
we met a couple of weeks later, ted was late.
he brought fabric books, and pictures of furniture only, which all came way over budget.
by the time we got to the budget i told him i could work with, there was basically no design.
just curtains and a couple of accessories.
what is that
this company is way too expensive with nothing to show for it.
please everyone .... take heed and do nt get caught up in the hype about decor and you working with every budget ...
this is just a way for them to squirm their way into your precious pocket
horrible.
horrible.
when we walked in, the person behind desk said   oh well, you must wait, i am in the middle of something.
after a good few minutes, he asked   what do you want
somewhere in between his rudeness he asked if we smoked.
i asked if this hotel had smoking rooms.
he immediately said  no, there is a  50 deposit now
sure enough he charged it to the credit card.
when i inquired he rudely replied  in the morning when things are checked out you ll get it back.
i called customer service about it because the website specifically states that there are no other charges at the check  in.
i also mentioned to the reception person.
he responded  we have problem with  people  .
imagine a hotel having problems with people.
i finally alerted him to his rudeness.
he said he s had a long and bad day.
we had no choice but to stay but will take this as far as we can.
do nt stay there.
i came to find out the person was the hotel owner also.
my friend and i were to stay here for a girls night, catch up on our lives evening.
we live within 20 miles of the hotel and wanted to get away from our responsibilities for the night.
unfortunalty my husband and i had to put our 13 year old lab down that morning and we were not expecting this.
my friend called the hotel to cancel our room as soon as i called her.
they said that we were to be charged for this room regardless because we did not cancel within the 72 hours.
i called them back a few hours after putting my bodhi down and they still would nt budge.
times are hard, i know, but they had no compassion.
i called3 times to talked to a manager, never a call back.
i emailed4 times, never a response.
in one of the emails i attached the letter from the vet s that expressed their sympathy, this hotel did nothing.
i even emailed mackinaw tourist and nothing.
i am sure this is a good place to stay from reading the other reviews, but if something unexpected happens in your life, they will not care.
fanfuckingtastic
ok i am a new yorker who has been going to school in oxford, england.
i thought the uk was completely devoid of good nyc style pizza.
i thought to get a decent pizza the only way was at a fancy restaurant, and i have to get a whole pie.
i thought i would have to wait until i went home to nyc.
well then i went on a trip to glasgow and was walking around.
i saw this place and it looked like the holy grail.
i knew i had found the real deal, big pies, sold by the slice, with the pizzas sitting under the glass in the front.
they have crushed red pepper flakes and oregano.
so i ordered a slice.
it tasted like i just flew back home.
i du n no how they did it, but scottish friends  this is the real deal.
i congratulated this establishment for doing the research on making nyc pizza because these scots fcking nailed it.
that being said, i do nt know how their delivery service is.
they might want to change the name to reflect the new yorkedness of the pizza, scrummy yummy sounds gimmicky to me.
good food, good wait staff, poor management
we visited on 72608 for dinner we received a gift certificate for the mama mia s on greenfield ave.
the food was good, and so was our waitress.
when it came time to pay the bill up front, they would not let me use any of the certificate for a tip  which i have done with any other restaurant i ve gotten a gift certificate for.
i then asked if i could have money back in cash.
the person went to go check with the manager, who was sitting at a table chatting with her friends who were eating there.
her answer was short and manner rather rude.
sorry for interrupting i guess.
the cashier was also short, unapologetic and made me feel as i was wasting her time.
there were no other options available  i only brought my check card to cover any overage cost  and she rang it up and applied it to the gift card before telling me about the tip policy.
i will not be visiting mama mia s again.
there are other places with food just as good with management that values customers and employees much more.
dining at texas roadhouse
texas roadhouse has very good meals, that the meat comes right off the bones.
it has very good prices.
on a bad note the waiting area is not enjoyable or enough seats.
also, there should not be peanuts all over the floor.
next, there should only be one person bringing you your food.
it s not a big deal but i had to take my salad home because they forgot to bring it.
i had to ask the girl who brought my food and she never came back to let me know.
i had to wait for my waitress.
when you first come in the hostess is not very friendly, there is just a bunch of workers standing there.
i was there on march 6th, 2009.
i was also there of july 4th 2008, when my daughter s buffalo wings came out with a fly on it.
the manager came over and said he was sorry and gave a new batch of wings, he said we ca nt really do anything because the doors are always opening and closing.
in my opinion should of just took off the price of the wings from the bill.
but everyone has there own way
mezza luna ftw
their mezza lunas are deffly better than the pizza rolls.
it s like a pizza roll, but they just toss ham and cheese inside.
it seems like it s healthier too, but it s prolly not.
also, you can call em ahead of time, and then go to pick up ur food, or have it delivered .
that cuts down on teh wait time, cus u can do other stuff while u r waiting.
it usually takes 20 mins for a mezza luna, as they have to add pure delicious extract to the mix.
their pizza was a little salty for me, but it s still good.
they do that whole thing where you sandwich the pepperoni between layers of cheese for  32 delicious.
anyways, the mezza luna  you should try it.
it runs you about4 bucks and it deals crushing blows to hunger.
edit  living on campus at clarkson university, i have had food delivered before.
this was back between 05 and 09 and i do nt remember how many times we ve had it delivered.
perhaps they do nt deliver anymore, but the deliciousness of a mezza luna certainly warrants a pickup.
my 2004 x  type was getting close to 100,000 miles so it was time for an upgrade.
i sent my wife and daughter over to check out a preowned 2009 xf.
michael chestney was very pleasant and patient with my wife and she suggested i go check it out.
i went in later that afternoon and met with michael.
he showed me the car i was interested in and we took a test drive.
i loved the car so we began negotiating my trade  in and the price of the 09 xf.
the entire negotiation took about 20 minutes.
fair give and take on both sides until we agreed on a deal that was within my parameters and was fair to both sides.
10 minutes of paperwork and i was the owner of a beautiful preowned 09 xf.
i have purchased over 15 vehicles  cars, rvs, and boats  in my lifetime and i have to say the experience with michael and barrett motor cars of san antonio was one of the best.
friendly, knowledgeable, and above all fair.
that s all you can really ask from a car dealer and michael and barrett hit all3.
thanks for the great deal and the great car
identity theft
myself and my fiance s identity was stolen from the office staff.
we were told by a detective and asked to check our credit for anything unusual.
luckily they caught the crooks before they did one on us.
it was a black female that use to work in the office.
she stole the information and gave it to another guy that did all the work.
the other guy was pulled over one day and a cop saw suspicious papers with names and social security numbers on it.
that s how they were caught.
they both went to jail and a new manager was put in charge of the apartments.
the apartment across from mine belonged to a gang of hookers.
nobody lived there.
a girl would show up, then a guy in a nice car would show up.
short time later the guy would leave, then the girl.
my apartment was usually quiet.
i lived in one that did not face the parking lot.
parking spaces are just big enough for a mini cooper.
it sucked having an suv.
if i found a spot, i could nt fit in it.
gates worked 30  of the time at best.
bugs were a small problem, nothing too bad.
the best there is in service.
i was recently traveling down i  24 from nashville with my3 young children and had a blowout on the southeast side of murfreesboro.
it was 450 when a friend told me to call bud, he would take care of me.
not only did they answer the phone at 450 on a thursday, they hit the ground moving.
they tracked down the only tire that fit my bmw 330i in murfreesboro within minutes and secured it, then they came out, took off my tire  it was a runflat  but runflats do nt do you any good if they blow out , and brought it to their shop to change the tire.
they were back quickly considering how far outside of murfreesboro we were and had us on our way by 630 that evening.
thanks bud for all of your help and taking time away from your family that evening.
it s without a doubt, the best service experience i ve ever had and just to be clear, the price he charged me was the same as my tire guy in nashville s price for putting on the other rear tire.
i hope i can return the favor in the future

room ok.
service and client base not ok.
i have stayed in this hotel many times, and while it typically offers a decent bang for the buck, its client base largely consists of troubled youngsteers and evictees from the local, not so pleasant hood.
i have never considered this a real problem as i travel without kids and can fend for myself, but when i had to listen to a  nonviolent  domestic fight that lasted from1 am to5 am during my last stay and i found out that the front desk was unmanned during night hours, my choice was to either waste tax payers money by calling for a yet another police dispatch to this hotel, or just get over it.
i chose the later, but approached the front desk about the hotel policy to push over their responsibilities on local authorities, not to mention the good night s sleep i paid for but did nt get.
i was told management would call me back but still waiting for that call.
i will probably stay here again because it s cheap and i ca nt afford a better hotel, but do not look forward to it and would definitely not recommend this hotel for families or single female travellers.
was there this past weekend and the guy behind the counter yelled at me and my son because we believed he left the grandma slice in the oven a little too long and the cheese got all dried out and the slice tasted more like a cracker.
he preceded to grab the slice off the countertop and throw it into the trash while yelling at me saying,  you do not order what you do not know about  and  you do nt know how pizza is made .
it was very upsetting to see this kind of behavior especially in front of my four year old.
he was in the process of making me a pie and when i got home, the pie was the worst i have ever seen.
cheese was falling off, so oily and greasy.
i think he did it on purpose because of my simple request for another slice of grandma that was nt so well  done  actually, burnt .
i will never go back to this place and i am reporting them to the better business bureau for such horrible customer relations and basically sabotaging my pizza and taking my  25.
this story is 100  true.
that little man who thinks he invented pizza can kiss my ss.
long lines, silly rules, rude staff, ok food
the first thing you notice when you arrive on location is that the waiting line literally goes out the door and spills into the parking lot.
a restaurant with this many patrons willing to stand in line just to order tacos must be good, right
i mean, that s the way it works at amusement parks  the longest lines are at the best rides.
well, this may be an exception.
the staff taking your order and  waiting  on you are very indifferent and have no sense of costumer service at all.
i have gotten better results talking to comcast customer service than with these folks.
and do nt even think about asking to speak to the manager because this guy is, and pardon my french, a jerk.
if you have gotten through ordering, dealing with the rude staff and if you followed the dumb rules, you are finally presented with what you came for .. some tacos that are  ok,  but definitely not worth putting up with all the hassle.
save yourself the trouble and skip this place all together.
i suggest you go up to raging taco  raging burrito a couple of blocks up the street or even taco mac.
wish this was in saratoga
we were introduced to bistro tallulah by traveler  professional diner who happens to own the adelphi hotel and travels the world  and residing in paris, london, new york the rest of the year.
she knows great food and dining experiences.
she was dead on  this restaurant was wonderful  do not be put off by the one negative review on this page.
i can tell you we were pleasantly surprised  bt has taste memory and each time back the food was consistently delicious  same dishes  were consistent.
our friend is a world traveler and loves unpretentious dining experiences and inspired food.
this chef knows what he is doing.
treat yourself and go  you will go back
i am a business owner in downtown saratoga springs and wish this restaurant was in our town
the affordable rent makes it possible for an inspired chef to serve his high quality fare at affordable prices
unlike saratoga.
i rrly seek the cehf out to introduce myself  but the second time we went  i made a point of asking our wait person to introduce my friend and myself to the chef to tell him just how good our meals were.
can not wait to go gain.
r. morris.
i think that the re pretty good.
first of all, if you call for an appointment they wo nt tell you to call back a month later so you can then make one.
they also do nt tell you that they re going to mail you an  application  to be admitted to be a patient.
i feel that the way some doctor s offices work around here is a little bit absurd so i m happy that these guys do nt do those two things in particlular.
usually you can be seen the same week or maybe the following week.
the doctor did tell me that my male pattern baldness is due to my mother s father because the gene is exclusively passed on through maternal line but that s a common misconception  httpwww.consumerreports.orghealthhealthylivingbeautypersonalcarehairloss1008hairloss.htm .
in general i would say that the staff is attentive and nice.
but then again i was nice to them so that could have been why.
anyhow, after reading some of the other reviews it seems like some of the other reviewers are expecting mircles.
if you want miracles you ll have to go to 21st st.
it s a pretty typical primary care office but for the area it s very good.
they do nt do certain things that are really annoying about other offices.
first trip to canada
i recently traveled to canada on business and had a most excellent experience.
i work for a large retail company recently expanding our operations into canada and had to travel to ensure all of our computer network equipment was installed properly and on time.
this can tend to be a stressful experience in itself let alone adding crossing boarders for the first time.
i was very pleased to find my accommodations and the hotel staff to be a very calming and comforting part of my trip.
i found the hotel to be amazingly clean, not to mention very well adorned with many pleasant surprises.
from my first encounter at check in to my regrettable check out i found the staff and facility to exceed my expectation.
i completely enjoyed my whole check in experience and was impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of the staff as well as the accommodations themselves.
i will be traveling in this area in the future and you can be assured that this experience will be helpful in my choice of hotels and novotel will be my first selection.
yes the parking can be a challenge but being from nj i am no stranger to tight corners.
please pass my appreciation to the staff and management for their excellent hospitality and good spirits as it helped make a stressful trip enjoyable.
favorite place in tampa.
update  i had to add to my review.
i was just in last night and had a chance to dine in their new dining room.
amazing
i frequent this resturant on a weekly basis but usally only for lunch.
well i was in for a treat when i was greeted by the friendly girls at the counter who asked if my wife and i would like to sit in their  new  dining room.
right away they told us that it was the same great food with the same prices so off we went.
we were greeted again and sat promptly.
after looking at the menu and seeing the new menu items they had, we knew we were in for a treat
i had the chicken parmesan dinner and my wife had the shrimp scampi dinner.
amazing
the portions were generous enough that we even took some home
i have to say the value of this place always amazes me.
it s nice to see that even in the economy we can eat a place that has upscale service, amazing atmosphere, and incredible food, but not break the bank while enjoying it
bottom line is that when it s a small privatly owned resturant like this is you can tell that the owners and employees take pride in their product and service.
well done
great work and honest establishment
i typically have work done on my jeep at the dealership, but it is6 years old now and getting charged dealership prices just did nt seem cost effective anymore.
i had tried out few place around the area and had been ripped off a few times.
i had hear great things about phet and gg automotive so i decided to give him a try.
the service was excellent and personable.
he checked out what i needed to have done told me what needed be fixed before he did any work and did great repair work.
the price was actually lower than what i had anticipated and used to compared to other places, plus he showed me the work he did when i came in to pick up the car.
also, a week after the work, phet called me up to see how my car was running and to let me know that they had accidentally overcharged me for part of the work and wanted to give me a refund for that amount.
that is just unheard of these days
i grew up in a small town where you knew and trusted your mechanic and was really cynical about city auto repair shops since i moved here, but phet has shown that there really are honest hard working mechanics around.
he is my mechanic going forward
our company is a high end designer handbag and fashion accessories company, thus we are certainly a niche market.
we had been evaluating seo providers for quite some time and finally decided to take the plunge with stuart, and ulistic.
we made the decision for a couple of reasons.
1. social media.
we were familiar with search engine optimization strategies, but new nothing about social media  we just heard that it was the next big thing.
2. we really liked the fact that stuart sets defined objectives and we meet once a month to go over our key performance indicators.
how has it gone so far
well we have been working with ulistic for 1.5 months, and have 100 people following our site on facebook, and our web site, www.designofashion.com has seen a3 fold increase in traffic, which is significantly beating our expectations  seo is a process that takes time and to get results this quickly is exceptional.
we are absolutely confident that stuart s ethical and focused strategies will see these trends continue to grow, and our business will reap the rewards of this program.
finally, it must be said that stuart is a fantastic person to work with, because of his solid strategies and equally as importantly because he is a genuinely good person and a great communicator.
excellent service and quality
i had hom  excel replace most of the windows in my tampa residence three years ago.
the excellent windows have performed without any problems, but that s not why i m writing my review.
three weeks ago, burglars tried to gain entry into the rear of my home.
the intruders slit the screen of the window.
next, they tried to force the window with a pry bar and then to break the window with a hammer.
the window did nt break
my next  door neighbor heard the noise and turned on a light, thankfully scaring the two miscreants away  they even left their hammer behind  .
i called home  excel the next day to order a replacement screen for the window, and was happily surprised when they said that they were nt even going to charge me for the replacement screen ... that it would be covered under their guarentee.
lo and behold, they replaced the screen  which had to be ordered  yesterday and did nt charge me a dime.
their worker even cleaned3 of my windows and changed a lightbulb for me.
in this day and age, it is so rare to find a company with such nice workers and such far ranging guarantee policies.
i rarely write reviews such as this one, but they certainly deserve anyone s business
friendly staff, but definitely some problems
may, 2009.
we were booked at the sheraton with a number of other out  of  town wedding guests.
got put into the wrong room the first night, and were quite surprised to have someone with the same room key trying to get in the door at 100 am
next day got moved into another room, on the same floor with other wedding guests.
there were3 adults in our room but towels for only2, no linens for sofa bed.
in the second room it took3 tries to get all the towels and linens we requested.
a package and some wedding cards were left in our first room.
they were sent to our second room and had been opened  the ribbon  wrapped present, and all3 envelopes.
security in the hotel seemed to be excellent, but we were never given an explanation as to why someone would open these items.
a midafternoon  fire drill  was disruptive, putting everyone out of the hotel.
when we called the front desk about an extremely boisterous crowd in the hall outside our door quite late at night, it seemed to take the hotel staff quite a while to quiet them down.
the staff was friendly, especially the front desk female supervisor, and seemed to want to help, but too many unusual things happened to make us want to stay there again.
be careful of who your sales guy is
i think this place is probably really great especially judging by the reviews on here.
my experience was awful though.
it all had to do with the sales guy which was a young 22 year old who had admittedly only been working for2 weeks.
i was extremely interested in the car and very likely would have bought it, but the sales guy i dealt with ruined the deal.
essentially, i told him i did nt trust him cause he was a car salesman, but he got so incredibly offended at that statement that he had to go cry to another salesman and compose himself before coming back.
i do nt know if the kid had a bad day or what, but i had to sit and apologize about nothing for 10 minutes until he dropped the issue.
after that, i just tried to ignore his lack of professionalism and test drive the car.
i played dumb and asked him questions that i already knew the answers to and he responded with half truths and a few falsehoods.
for instance i asked who owned mazda and he said with confidence that was gm, which is nt true.
i mean, i do nt care if he does nt know, but if he pretends to know and tells me bs to my face, there s no way i m going to trust him when matters turn to the price of the car and financing.
the worst chinese i ve ever had
this is by far the worst chinese food i have ever had.
the service stunk.
i called in my order and upon arriving to pick it up, they got my order confused with someone else s.
they helped about three other people before they offered to help me again.
they also got my friend s order mixed up and wanted to charger her  10 more than what she had wanted.
she asked for the dinner combo and they gave her two dinner plates instead.
we were standing in the store for 20 minutes to simply pick up an order.
not to mention that the wait staff was about as pleasant as dealing with an angry bull.
they were abrasive and rude  when they were the ones who messed everything up.
we had to throw out about 80 percent of our meals because the food tasted so horrible.
i do nt know how it is possible to make orange chicken, sesame chicken and kung pao chicken as well as cheese puffs taste that bad but china delight accomplished that.
the only thing that was edible was the steamed rice and the vegetable lo mein was barely tolerable.
i will never go here again.
lucky panda in willis is a billion times better in service and quality of the meal.
i have no idea how china delight won number1 chinese restaurant in montgomery  there needs to be a recount on that vote.
terrible service
one of the worst experiences i ve ever had with a auto repair shop.
we took our vehicle in for a repair to the air conditioning.
approx4 months later, the compressor went out.
we took it back in to have it repaired again, and less than a week later the second compressor went out.
we went in for a third visit and they fixed it again, but this time when we picked up the car, the radio and clock did not work.
so for the 4th time in5 months and the third time in2 weeks, we brought the car back again.
when we expressed our discontent to the manager  that s right, the manager , did he say he would return some money, did he say he would give a discount on our next visit, did he just say  i m sorry .
nope, none of the above.
he stood there and told us how he was nt at fault.
it was the fault of the parts supplier, and can we imagine how he felt having to put another2 hours of work in the car.
and what did we expect ... that he bench test every part.
at no time during the conversation did the words,  i m sorry  ever come out of his mouth.
i, nor anyone else in my family, will ever go to sun devil auto again.
well, unless of course the third compressor he put in the car goes out.
do not use this company
i dropped off a sheet metal piece that i needed copied due to th it was needing to be replaced.
i asked if they could copy the piece i dropped off.
they said it would be made exactly like the one i needed to replace.
i picked it up when it was finished and was charge 30.00.
when i got to the job and tried to insert the new piece of metal it would not fit
i took the original piece of metal and rigged it to make due since i had to complete the job.
i took the receipt and the metal that did not fit and asked pomper for my money back.
the girl at the desk was sooo rude i could not believe it
she told me she could not use the piece i was returning and the company would only put it in the trash so i could not return it.
i explained i did not get what i paid for.
she asked me to bring the original piece back and i told her i had to use it on the job.
she told me that was to bad she would do nothing to help me since she could not use or resell the piece.
i said i was going to trash it also and could i at least have a credit.
with a smirk on her face she told me no money is being returned and that is the way it was.
do not use this company.
there are to many people that need our business to have to put up with this unfair treatment
i would never recommend this gym to anyone and unfortunately this is based solely on the owner s own unprofessionalism.
when i originally joined in january i only did so because i was told i would be able to cancel the 12 month membership if i was to move away.
i signed up with one of the staff who was very pleasant and professional.
actually working out there was good  the machines are nice and the classes are fun.
the locker room is certainly lacking  i would never shower or change there.
they need to update the locker rooms asap.
back to my poor rating  i was excepted to medical school and went in to cancel my membership as i was told i could do since i was moving away.
the owner was very rude, accused me of not reading my contract, and basically told me to shut up when i was trying to ask questions to further understand the process of canceling my membership.
i was able to cancel it but only after paying a  50 fee  which the staff person who signed me up stated i would not have to pay if i had proof of moving  and being spoken to in a very belittling manner.
i would understand if i was being treated this way by a staff member but the club s actual owner
bad for business.
i was appalled.
i will never recommend this gym to any woman.
the equipment and classes are nt good enough to deal with the rudeness from the staff
there are better places on the cape  fitness 500
the salon experience from hell
i feel obligated to share this story.
right out of college i called the salon and explained my situation.
just graduated, just moved, not rich, and starting new job soon.
i never got a price quote over the phone and they take your cc info just to make the appointment because if you do nt show up, they ll charge you.
i had this ridiculous celebrity stylist from la named derrick.
after he already put product on my hair he said  i should warn you, i m expensive.
what was i supposed to do, say i ca nt afford you and walk out with crap all over my hair.
i wanted to be very blonde and instead he pulled my root color throughout my whole hair which is a gross mousey brown.
the other stylists around me kept pressuring me saying he s so wonderful, you re going to love your hair.
400 later my jaw dropped when the receptionist told me the total.
derrick did a terrible job, was a complete jerk the entire time, and i had no warning as to the price.
i cried the entire way home.
he then  fixed  it for free but it still looked like crap.
i will never go back.
it was the salon experience from absolutely hell.
he also told me that he worked on the cast of will and grace and that they were all jerks.
that s my favorite show of all time.
i m pretty sure for the cast that it was the other way around.
maybe he did nt do a good job and they told him so.
absolute nightmare
stay away
very unhappy ...
working with rod jacobsen was my first experience working with a cpa, so i did not know what to expect.
that said  he seemed to be doing well enough.
however, then i asked to amend my return to apply a credit i had just become eligible for.
i expected to pay for this service, but imagine my surprise when i received a bill for more than what i paid to have the original return prepared.
asked why, rod simply told me that he had to research how to do the amendment  it was an amended to show that i had purchased a home  nothing out of the ordinary, one would think  and that took time to figure out.
well, that was strike one.
i was nt going to use them again, but i was going to leave it at that.
however, now that i have come to realize that i am going to owe the irs  6,000  despite doing exactly what rod told me to do, i feel i have to voice my opinion.
last year, after all was said and done, i asked rod whether my payment structure would leave me with no  little tax liability at the end of the year.
he said yes.
well, again, i am now faced with a tax bill of  6,000 , all due on april 15, 2010 and all that rod has to say to the matter is  well, you wo nt have to pay a penalty.
i may not have to pay a penalty, yet, but this is not what i had in mind when hired these guys.
in the words of my new accountant, they let me down
bit sketchy, sporadic delivery times
i bought about half of the furniture i own from this place.
why
because they cut me good deals if i paid in cash.
sketchy, right
well they came through and delivered almost all of my items within a few days.
they even got me a couch pretty quickly.
the guy who was cutting me the deals and getting me the furniture quickly, ahmed, was nice and mostly professional, except the semisketchiness.
then one day, ahmed left the country, not to return for months, without informing me.
he also neglected to tell the other person working at the store about a dining room table that i had ordered and that was supposed to be coming in.
the other person working at the store did nt know that i still had this table coming.
i had paid in cash, and he said he had no receipt  record of my purchase.
i came back with the receipt ahmed had provided upon my purchase, and the guy took forever to copy it but said that he would take care of the situation.
i waited.
and waited.
he never once contacted us.
i ve had to pester this new guy several times to ask when my table will arrive.
he kept saying different arrival  delivery dates and did nt seem terribly apologetic.
it has been3 weeks and i still do nt have my table  which was not cheap, i might add .
point is  you might be able to get a good deal on some nice furniture  which i did  but they re not very communicative and god forbid something goes wrong, you ll have to fight to get it resolved.
poor service
run do nt walk.
my experience with home delivery service has been one of disappointment and anger.
if i could give them a lower rating than poor i would.
on august 21st, 2009 i ordered furniture from hickory furniture mart and contracted for hds to deliver it.
after seventeen days the delivery van showed up at my home minus two pieces.
i was later told they had been left at the warehouse and some future date they would be delivered.
no one will give me a date.
i spent  2300 on the bedroom suite, which was complete and excellent condition on the showroom floor.
upon delivery it was clear the entire set was damaged  a piece of wood was broke on the headboard  the chest of drawers was missing all four pieces necessary to attach the legs  the dresser back legs were pushed in causing the dresser to lean into the wall  and a nighstand was missing a drawer.
how do you lose a drawer.
after complaining on september 10th to national home furnishings, boyles, the hickory furniture mart and home delivery service the latter finally called me back and said they would be up to pick the dresser and chest of drawers at some future point and at some later point it would be professional repaired and at some later point it would be returned.
the customer service at home delivery service was terrible let alone their promise to proper set up furniture.
so i am in limbo regarding a bedroom suite.
i hope the owners and employees of this store have broken bedroom suites in their homes and furniture sitting in someone s warehouse.
maybe then they will begin to understand poor customer service and terrible sit up service.
excellent driving school
i was involved in a car accident 20 years ago and since then i ve been a nervous wreck and have nt been behind the wheel.
unfortunately, a family emergency required me to conquer this fear.
a very good friend of mine highly recommended the professional driving school and i was told to specifically ask for gerry.
she highly recommended him and described him as the  saintly instructor and simply the best instructor there is .... very calm, pleasant and very detailed in giving instructions .
i called the school most probably 10 times before i finally enrolled in a 20 hour package.
i had to cancel my initial lesson4 times and on the 5th attempt the management was quick enough to associate my cancellations with my fear and finally encouraged me into taking my initial lesson.
five minutes before my initial lesson, i got a call from gerry advising me of his arrival and to come down as soon as i was ready.
my heart pounded as i walked down and pounded even faster upon seeing gerry in an suv  lexus
i thought of canceling the lesson once again because i did nt feel comfortable driving an suv.
gerry pleasantly said  since i am already here why do nt we give it shot.
i trust you and believe that you ll be able to handle this and all you have to do is to reciprocate
trust me and most especially trust and believe in yourself.
do nt worry, i ll take care of you
....... the rest was history
here i am now driving confidently on my own.
gerry, i ca nt thank you enough for helping me cope with my fear.
to my friend, thank you for your recommendation ... you were true to your words in saying gerry is a  saintly instructor ... absolutely simple the best instructor and best driving school there is
review on house of joy chinese restaurant
my family and i moved to san antonio a year ago and have tried almost all of the chinese restaurants because we love chinese food.
well it took us a while to find one that we liked.
but we do nt just like house of joy we love it.
everything we have gotten there has been more authentic and better tasting than any other chinese restaurant in the san antonio area we have been to  and trust me we have been to a lot of them.
we just happen to stumble across this little restaurant one day when we had to visit the bexar county tax office off of bandera road.
we stopped in and got some take out and can not stop going back.
they have the best egg drop soup i have ever tasted.
we also love their egg rolls and spring rolls.
and every entree we have ordered is perfect.
everything is always cooked fresh and tastes fresh.
their prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food you receive.
the staff is also just so pleasant to deal with.
they are also quick at getting your order out to you.
you do nt have to sit and wait around forever like most places
so anyone looking for an excellent night out for chinese or maybe just lunch should stop in and try it because i promise you2 things  you wo nt regret it
and you will go back for more
karla ferguson  granger
ps i have noticed on here that someone left a comment that  all of the nice comments must come from co workers or friends  and i will tell you that i do nt know these people except from eating at their restaurant.
we are from virginia and just moved here a year ago.
so that comment is completely false.
because we think it s the best
and we do nt know them except for eating there.
dr. strzalka at flagship cvts is not a good doctor
i am not sure about the quality of the other doctors there, but i do know from personal experience that dr. christopher t. strzalka is not a man of his word, and is also very cruel and uncaring
he was going to operate and replace my bicuspid aortic valve due to critical aortic stenosis.
i had a surgery date of july 17, 2008.
then he renigged when he read my health care proxy, even though i agreed to be on the ventilator for2 months following surgery  as he had twice stated i must agree to .
he later said that by2 months he  meant at least two months .
two months and at least two months are totally different things.
he did not even give me the chance to say i would stay on the ventilator longer, which i would have.
a health care proxy is not written in stone and can be changed.
he also never even said he was sorry.
just said i was inoperable and walked out of the hospital room.
so, therefore, now he says i am inoperable  even though i am not 100  inoperable , and he is letting me die.
i am just middle aged and do not want to die, but thanks to this doctor i have no other alternatives.
i, along with my friends, consider this doctor to be the cause of my death as he is not even trying to save my life by operating.
even my pa i went to the other day said  it must by comforting to have gone to a heart surgeon like him who will do nothing for you .
he said it sarcastically.
if you want a doctor who will lie to you and say he will operate and then change his mind, and not know what he is talking about when he recommends procedures at other hospitals and says they are what you need, when they will not work for you, go to this doctor ... he is the one for you.
what you can learn from the below  bad experience .
i would suggest not avoiding second home based on the  bad experience  review.
i d probably be more inclined to board my two dogs here, seeing that they do nt just take every dog coming in.
i ve toured this place and was impressed by how clean the place was, and all the options for the dogs.
it s unfortunate that bmil believed that his  perfect  dog was not given the right opportunity to prove himself.
but i ve done hundreds of dog introductions myself  another place, i do nt work here , and owners can have unrealistic expectations and views of what they see when their dogs meet other dogs.
workers who do these introductions look at the interaction objectively  and it s good to see they are able and willing to say no if they feel there would be a problem.
it sounds  according to your own statement  that they had a roomful of dogs, so they must be doing something right  and are keeping those dogs safe from potential problems.
you say you work a lot, and that you have a young dog  so i have little doubt that your dog is just filled with energy to burn  and it is good of you to look for a place to take him.
but not at a risk to other people s pets.
you were clearly given another alternative by second home, to board him  which might have given your dog a chance to come and go from second home a couple times, getting used to the place and maybe facilitating another attempt to get into daycare later.
no business is going to push customers away without good reason  so is nt it reasonable to think they might know what they re doing
my dogs are far from perfect, and one of them i believe would be a little much for daycare here herself  at least initially .
be a little more reasonable with your expectations of a place like this  and maybe do nt jump to personal attacks suggesting that they do nt want to work hard, just because you bruised your own ego.
dumbest fers ever
i called dominos tonight, it rang forever, i get put on hold twice without saying a word and finally someone says, may i help you
so i say  i m at the radison warwick hotel in rittenhouse square  built in 1926  do you deliver to the warwick
they say no, warwick in new jersey, call new jersey.
i laugh and say, no, that warwick is in new york, but i m at the radison  warwick.
and he says  you re at warwick in pennsylvania
and i said, yes, center city philly, and he says, no, warwick is a township, if you re at a radison in warwick that s too far, try dominos in pottstown.
i say, no, i am at the radison warwick hotel in rittenhouse square.
he says  i not know that town, i have to get to work, i m in philly.
call dominos in your town.
i say listen  i m at 17th and locust, do you deliver there
he says, i have to have an exact address.
ok, 1701 locust street i say.
he says  why you tell me you r in warwick township
he gives the phone to a girl, she says, i have to have your address, i say, do you deliver to 17th and locust, she says, your exact address, i say1 7 0 1 locust, are you sure  she asks
yes i am sure, well, she says, is that on 17th street.
yes, i say.
17th, like over by 16th and 15th yes, i say, one mile west of you.
you re at 7th.
i am just south of walnut.
she says, is that 17th like over past broad.
yes, i am west of broad.
broad, i say, is 14th street and i am3 blocks west of broad and one south of walnut.
hmmm, she says, then why are you calling here, we do nt go past broad
anyway, after much yelling and cussing i hung up, grabbed a cab, and went to geno s.
quick to take money but not quick to fix a problem
bb came out very quickly to give us our quote back in june.
they were very polite, eager to answer any questions and willing to wait for us to return from vacation to begin installing our fence.
our fence was installed quickly in august and they had their money and left saying  workmanship is guaranteed for a year  .
within a week we noticed one of the boards on our gate splitting where a nail had gone in.
we called our representative who assured me he would call the office and have it taken care of.
we heard nothing.
we then called the office and the man we spoke to said he d send someone out to look at it but could nt promise when  two weeks came and went and we heard nothing.
i just called again and was told that workmanship, not wood, is guaranteed for a year  well in my opinion  the wood split due to a nail which is part of workmanship
she even went so far as to say  you r calling about one board
well  when you pay over  1000 for something you want it to hold up and look good
yes
i was calling about one board
i m very frustrated at this point  it would take all of 10 min for them to come by and replace the one board that is cracked  the crack is deep enough to stick a penny in it and it goes clear through  yet they do not want to take the time to bother with what once was a happy customer and has now become a dissatisfied customer.
so i figure if they do nt want to take the time to fix the fence that they installed then i ll take the time to let everyone i can know about how they treat customers once they have your money
stay away
you get what you pay for
they came in under a lot of other quotes and now i know why
when the fence was first installed i would have given them five stars, now for their poor customer follow  up and unwillingness to fix the fence they have dropped to a one  star in my opinion
lots of rules, phantom innkeeper, last minute price was worth it.
i called the  207  number and listened to the same recording loop3 times before i gave up.
i then called the 800 number  which was answered  and inquired about last minute rates.
they had a room with a  99 rate, which i booked.
the room was supposed to be on the 2nd floor, but they put us on the 3rd.
the email confirmation  which i read in the car  warned about large suitcases, declaring that we are innkeepers, not longshoreman.
in other words, they do not help with suitcases, but they promise totes to help.
however upon our arrival no one there  the inn was open .
so no totes.
finally a chambermaid stuck her head around the corner from the top of the stairs and told us sternly that we could not be accommodated until3 m, no exceptions.
then she was gone.
we returned after3 pm, found no one there, and a note from the innkeeper with directions to our room.
rules in the room  1  if you drink the soda from the fridge in your room you must prove it by leaving the can in the trash.
if they think you ve taken a soda from your room home with you, they will charge you  1.50 per can.
they count the cans in the trash to make sure.
2  if you take the shampoo products home, they will charge you 8 per item.
if you want a late checkout,  after 11 am  they charge you  15 for the first hour,  25 for the second hour, and after2 pm it s a full day charge.
4  breakfast is8 am to 10 am.
no earlier and no later.
if you go later, it s all cleaned up.
by whom, i do nt know.
i never saw anyone there.
all these rules are posted in the rooms.
snacks  uninspired bread, tea backs, and individual coffee things for a machine that did nt exist.
i put the coffee thing in hot water and settled for a cup of weak coffee.
no wine glasses.
room was clean, but had a weird, dated, sink  stove combo that did nt work.
bath was clean except shower stall which had mildew problems.
no tub.
the inn touts a shower with dual shower heads, but only one worked.
do nt get the rooms off the two kitchens.
they are right off the kitchen so you hear everything.
free parking.
i d go back if i could get the last minute rate again of  99, but i would nt pay their rack rate.
quit with the overstatements
the worst thing that can happen for any restaurant like zahav is to have too many people write hyperbolic reviews making claims that  everyone  is going to  love  the food, decor and service.
the truth is, in my and my dining partners  experience, this is a fine little restaurant with some unique food.
it s an entirely up and down experience, however.
now, the best of that unique food comes at the very beginning of the meal.
the salatim salads are the smallest plates i ve ever seen placed in front of me  you would most likely think they were condiments if it were nt explained to you .
though they are mostly excellent, you generally do nt get enough forkfuls to know if you really love them.
that being said, the laffa and hummus are out of this world.
then again, for the three of us who dined together, two pieces of flatbread left us fighting for more, and licking the hummus from our fingers  and yes, those two pieces of flatbread did represent a three  person order .
dinner was also an up  and  down experience.
the vegetarian dishes and lighter fare were almost always spot  on, while the lamb was often dry and  or overcooked.
the duck was a 65  glob of chewy fat with no resemblance to the juicy, crispy delicacy it usually represents at other establishments.
dessert was ... hmmm, that s interesting, i do nt even remember dessert.
i guess that tells you a lot.
oh, yes, the chocolate semifreddo was quite good.
the warm chocolate cake was very tasty, but served at room temperature, not warm by any stretch of the imagination.
and my  no, i still do nt remember what i had.
service was average, but nothing special, and restaurants that are supposed to be excellent should do a better job of training their waitstaff to be communicative and friendly, not merely capable.
perhaps had we not gone into this restaurant believing zahav was going to be golden as its name suggests  and as the many golden reviews seem to attest , we would have enjoyed a decent little expensive experience.
but one should not go here expecting something fantastic, unless perhaps you ve never had middle  eastern food before, or succulent duck, tasty lamb, decent portion sizes or actually warm chocolate desserts.
ps  when we called for a reservation, we were told that 500 and 930 were their only openings.
when we arrived at5, and left circa7, there were the same4 or5 empty tables surrounding us.
did they think we were going to feel lucky to get any reservation at all, and therefore be more pleased with our dining experience
must read  do not waste your time in this store.
at my appointment the girl helping me was unable to adequately lace up some of the dresses.
they felt like they were going to fall off of me and it was very difficult to see what i would actually look like were i to purchase some of these dresses.
i thought it would be a good idea to see how a few that i liked would look like on a model  by looking the dress up online .
so, as i was leaving i asked for the designer  dress name or style number associated with my top picks.
they said they were  unable to tell me until they ordered my dress .
hmmm ... a person can not call a company, if you have no idea its name  since the designer is unknown ... supposedly , and order a gown without a dress name or style number.
do other brides fall for this
they either  a  do nt want to give it to me because they do nt want me purchasing the dress elsewhere or b  are recreating the dresses themselves  ie stealing other designers  dress designs and  filling the orders  by their own seamstresses .
i m no detective but ... uhh ... seriously
whatever type of operation they are running, i m not interested and if you re smart, you wo nt be either.
what a waste of time.
aside from that little  mystery , one of the sales ladies was quite comfortable telling me how wrong i was about how another dress that i loved compared to one of her dresses that i was trying on.
somehow, since she supposedly does nt know any names of designers  dresses, after i told her the designer and dress name of the one i was comparing, she knew  exactly which dress  i was referring to and disagreed with my observation  she said that the bodice did come as low as the one i had on.
my point  even if i was wrong, do nt sit there and argue with the customer.
say something like,  huh.
i did nt think so but you could be right.
unless you want to take the  tell the customer how wrong she is and try and force her into a dress she s obviously not loving  approach which will likely get you ... uh ... nowhere.
seriously  do not waste your time.
other shops around this city have much nicer and more transparent owners.
not owners that seem like they have something to hide and know nothing about common courtesy and customer service.
i felt very much like wedding gallery was being dishonest and i would nt trust them to lace me up in another gown let alone trust them with the gown i will wear on the most important day of my life.
awful service
after happily visiting sears automotives in the past, i was shocked at the horrible service received at their greensboro location.
i brought my car in on a sunday to replace a shredded tire.
i waited about 20 minutes in the store part before anyone was able to assist me and was then told to pull my car into the shop  that is apparently what you are supposed to do, but the big signs pointing you that way are for some reason kept inside the garage, so you do nt see them drving up, and they purposely block the front pull  up that all other sears use .
once inside, i had to stand around for at least 10 more minutes before  finally  a technician got to me.
once i returned to pick up my car, you can believe i spent quite a bit more time standing around waiting.
i had wanted to split the total between a credit card and check card since i was being reimbursed for the tire but was told this was nt possible.
once i actually got back in my car, it was dirty and had grease all over the steering wheel.
ok, one bad experience ... fine.
the following friday, i returned with my car to go ahead and replace the other3 tires, which were worn.
i would not have gone back, but i could nt find the particular tire they d used in stock anywhere else.
once again, i waited for quite a bit before being attended to.
i got the order completed, and then questioned the technician since it came out about  40 less than i expected.
he said it was the same tire, and verified this, after checking both the actual tire on my car and my service papers from earlier in the week.
however, when he printed out the service quote, i could see that it was not the correct tire, and was not even an appropriate tire for my car model.
so i pointed this out to him, at which point he said they only had one of the correct tires in stock.
ok  fine.
so i got just my other rear tire replaced.
they promised it d be done within an hour, so i waited in the lobby.
over two hours later  and ten minutes before they closed  my car was finally finished.
a few minutes after i left, i was called and informed that  i  left my wheel lock  which they should have left in the car .
of course, they would be closing in5 minutes, so i would have to hurry up or get it the next day.
of course i could nt make it back in time  and they apparently could not stay5 extra minutes to wait for me .
the next day, no one could find my wheel lock and that particular technician was not in.
of course, they could nt call him either to ask about it because apparently they do nt keep their employees  phone numbers  riiight , so i would have to return on monday  driving for3 days now with no wheel lock should i get a flat .
on monday i called and again it was a big to  do to find anyone who knew anything about it.
supposedly they will be holding it for me this evening, but i m sure that will also be a huge ordeal.
the employees at this sears are completely apathetic and there did nt seem to be any sort of management that i could see.
i will never return there again  and now have some serious doubts about the quality of work they actually performed on my car .
